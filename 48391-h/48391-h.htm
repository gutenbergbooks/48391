<p>"A good wine needs no bush" is an old English
proverb, and this is essentially true in regard
to the art of the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain
Factory. The late M. Louis Solon, in preparing
his colossal bibliographic work on <i>Ceramic
Literature</i>, called my attention to the curious
fact that a small pamphlet (some four and a
half by five inches square, of fourteen pages)
written by me originally for the <i>Artist</i> magazine
in 1902, and reprinted as a guide to the
Royal Copenhagen porcelain exhibit at the Wolverhampton
Exhibition in 1902, was marked "rare"
and being sold to collectors for five shillings.
M. Solon, with his usual perspicacity, added: "It
looks as though, in its course from East to West,
ceramic painting has deserted its old home to
take refuge in the North. <i>C'est du Nord aujourd'hui
que nous vient la lumi√®re!</i>"</p>

<p>In 1911, <i>Royal Copenhagen Porcelain: Its
History and Development from the Eighteenth
Century to the Present Day</i> was issued by my
publisher, who in bringing out this sumptuous
monograph fell under the spell of the beauty of
Copenhagen art. That volume appealed to connoisseurs
and collectors and was welcomed both
here, on the Continent, and in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>It has been thought desirable, in view of the
limited circulation of that volume, to issue a
popular edition, which is here presented in a
slightly abridged form with none of the essentials
omitted. Many of the illustrations have not
found their way into this gallery. But a brave
array of pictures is given to convey to the general
reader, and to those who have not perused the
larger volume, the chief characteristics of Royal
Copenhagen porcelain, and indicate reasons why
this factory is now regarded as the leading factory
in Europe.</p>

<p>How many of the great factories of the world
can claim two great epochs in their history? But
Copenhagen can do this. The first is the M√ºller
period (overglaze decoration), when the factory
assumed its well-known mark, in 1775, of the
three blue lines indicating the three waterways
of Denmark&mdash;the Sound and the Great and Little
Belts. The second great period, the Modern
Renaissance (underglaze decoration), practically
commenced in 1885.</p>

<p>The porcelain of this factory has long been
held in high esteem. Admiral Nelson in 1801,
when with the British fleet outside Copenhagen,
wrote to Lady Hamilton, "I was in hopes to
have got off some Copenhagen china to have
sent you"; and later, "As I know you have
a valuable collection of china, I send you some
of the Copenhagen manufacture." The bowl
made at the royal factory in memory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
brave Danes who fell in the battle of Copenhagen
is herein illustrated.</p>

<p>The <i>Encyclop√¶dia Britannica</i> (11th Edition),
1911 (article on <i>Ceramics</i>), awards a high place
to the Royal Copenhagen Factory, "the productions
of which are not only famous all over
the world, but have set a new style in porcelain
decoration which is being followed at most of
the continental factories."</p>

<p>At the present time museums and private
collectors in this country and in various parts
of the world are acquiring Royal Copenhagen
porcelain on account of its artistic character.</p>

<p>Ordinary collectors of porcelain have always
been desirous of selecting a subject which has not
been exploited. The Worcester vase which to-day
brings two thousand guineas at Christie's
was once bought when it was new for as many
shillings by some person who recognized its beauty.
But in regard to old factories, most of the histories
have been written to extol their work when the
factory had closed down for ever. The lack
of contemporary records of English porcelain
is particularly noticeable. It is as though the
factories attempted to hide their personalities,
as indeed they did disguise their productions
by trade signs only decipherable by the indefatigable
zeal of later generations. They assumed
pseudo-Chinese marks or adopted the crossed
L's of S√®vres and the crossed swords of Meissen,
to the confusion of collectors a hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
afterwards. It is therefore with no misgiving
that in the present volume modernity receives
due consideration. National recognition for the
artist potter comes, alas! often too late.</p>

<p>In passing, we may add that there are some
wonderful productions being made in England to-day,
especially in earthenware, and those who are
buying wisely are laying down wine for posterity.</p>

<p>I have to offer my renewed thanks to the
various museum authorities, mainly in Scandinavia,
and to private collectors and friends who were
duly acknowledged in my larger volume as being
instrumental in affording me access to data on
a new subject.</p>

<p>In that work, although the omission was corrected
in the German edition published at Leipsic
in 1912, various notes were embodied and remain
in the present volume, which were supplied
to me by correspondents without any knowledge
on my part that they were based on the work of
Professor Nyrop of Copenhagen, who has made
assiduous research into the history of the old
Copenhagen factory, and to whom, therefore,
a tribute is in courteous acknowledgment obviously
due.</p>

<p>A new chapter has been added to this volume
dealing with Copenhagen Art Faience, the character
of which ware has claimed recognition from
competent critics throughout Europe and in
America as having brought a new note into
ceramic art.</p>

<p class="chap_overview">Establishment of porcelain factories in Europe&mdash;The
German School and the French School&mdash;Hard paste&mdash;Soft
paste&mdash;The new ceramic art&mdash;The great
secret&mdash;The secret divulged&mdash;The first porcelain in
Denmark.</p>


<p>In order to understand the initial stages in the
history of the manufacture of porcelain in Denmark,
it is necessary to review the peculiar
conditions in which china factories existed in
the eighteenth century. At the middle of the
century there were two great schools, the German
and the French. The former made hard or true
porcelain according to the formula of Meissen,
and the latter made soft or artificial porcelain in
the manner of St. Cloud.</p>

<p><b>Hard Paste.</b>&mdash;The impulse of the Western potter had always been
to reproduce exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span> and chemically the Oriental porcelain. Until the
first decade of the eighteenth century this had not been achieved. The
news of the great discovery by Johann Fredrich B√∂ttger, in 1709, of
a white translucent porcelain, having all the characteristics of the
Chinese ware, ran like a flame throughout Europe. Translucent porcelain
may be either what is termed hard paste (<i>p√¢te dure</i>), containing only
natural elements in the composition of the body and the glaze; or soft
paste (<i>p√¢te tendre</i>), where the body is an artificial combination of
various materials used as a substitute for the natural earths. All
Chinese or true porcelain is of the hard-paste variety. The term <i>p√¢te
tendre</i> really applies to the feeble resistance of this artificial
porcelain to the action of a high temperature as compared with that
offered by true porcelain, and also to the softness of the glaze, which
can be scratched by steel.</p>

<p>The body of the true porcelain is essentially
of two elements&mdash;the white clay or <i>kaolin</i>, the
infusible element which may be said to be the
skeleton, and <i>petuntse</i>, the felspathic stone, which
is fusible at a high temperature, which may be
termed the flesh, and gives transparency to the
porcelain. Of the two Chinese names, which
have become classical since they were adopted
in the dictionary of the French Academy, <i>kaolin</i>
is the name of a locality where the best porcelain
earth is mined, and <i>petuntse</i>, literally "white
briquettes," refers to the shape in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
finely pulverized porcelain stone is brought to
the Chinese potteries, after it has been submitted
to the preliminary processes of pounding and
decantation.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>Chinese Art</i>, vol. ii. p. 16, 1906, by Stephen W.
Bushell, C.M.G. (late Physician to H.M. Legation, Peking).</p></div>

<p><b>Soft Paste.</b>&mdash;The artificial porcelain, which was
difficult of fabrication, was an imitation of the
true Chinese porcelain, although its whiteness,
its translucency, and its brilliant glaze have all
the appearance of true porcelain. <i>Kaolin</i> and
<i>petuntse</i> are of little importance in the composition
of soft porcelain. Its transparency was
obtained by the addition of glass, its plasticity by
the use of soapstone, and its glaze by an admixture
of silica and lead. Moreover, the composition
of artificial porcelain has required researches and
combinations much more intricate than those
which had led to the discovery of hard porcelain,
the latter being produced by two substances
already provided by nature.</p>

<p>Imitative porcelain had been made at Florence
under the auspices of the Grand Duke of Tuscany
as early as from 1568 to 1587, of which <i>fabrique</i>
only about thirty pieces are known. France
is the most prolific in porcelain factories of the
<i>p√¢te tendre</i>, as it came afterwards to be termed
in contradistinction to the <i>p√¢te dure</i> or true
porcelain of Meissen. The factory at St. Cloud
lasted from 1695 till 1773. Vincennes was
founded in 1740, and was finally transferred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
S√®vres in 1756, which factory stands paramount in
its porcelain, known to collectors as <i>vieux S√®vres</i>.</p>

<p>At Nove, near Venice, in 1752, Pasqual Antonibon
brought from Meissen a potter, Sigismond
Fischer, to construct a furnace for making porcelain
in the Saxon style. In 1761 there were
three furnaces, one for hard paste <i>ad uso
Sassonia</i>, and two for soft paste <i>ad uso Francia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> <span class="correction" title="See Transcriber's Note at the end of this book."><i>Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain</i></span>, by William
Chaffers. (Letter from Francesco Antonibon to Lady Charlotte
Schreiber.)</p></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that the two schools had
begun to run side by side. The crowning point
was in 1768, when the S√®vres factory commenced
to make hard paste. Both bodies were
simultaneously made until 1804, after which the
manufacture of soft porcelain at S√®vres was
discontinued by M. Brongniart. In 1847, the
old style was revived by his successor, M. Edelman
(<i>Report on Pottery at the Paris Exhibition by
M. Arnoux</i>, 1867).</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that the manufacture
of soft porcelain is beset with difficulties and
uncertainties. Its artificial composition renders
it capricious in the kiln. In connection therefore
with the modern manufacture of S√®vres of the
old <i>p√¢te tendre</i> variety, it is interesting to record
that in the late eighties the original formul√¶ of
the early potters were used in an attempt to
reproduce the old body, but had, after repeated
and costly failures, to be abandoned as hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>In regard to England, it is interesting to note
in passing that the old porcelains so highly prized
by collectors are all artificial with the exception
of Plymouth (1768-1771), Bristol (1771-1781),
followed by the company of Staffordshire potters
at New Hall who bought the Bristol factory
patents, although Wedgwood in his jasper ware
and Staffordshire salt glazed ware are fine stone
wares which approximate to true porcelain.</p>

<p>Our soft-paste factories are here set in chronological
order: Bow (1745), Chelsea (1745), Derby
(1751), Worcester (1751), Lowestoft (1762), Caughley
(1772), Pinxton (1795), Coalport (1798), Minton
(1798). It should be observed that these, as do
all soft-paste porcelains, differ in body in an
enormous degree, whereas the true porcelain differs
in a minor degree whether it be Canton or Meissen.</p>

<p>It was only for fifty years that the English
potters used the capricious body of the glassy
soft porcelains then made. Gradually, by experiment,
the standard body for artificial porcelain
was perfected by the addition of bone-ash, which
has been adopted since the late eighteenth century
in varying forms by all English potters. It is
more related to true porcelain, and is as safe to
manufacture as that body, and at a lower heat,
but it retains many of the qualities of the soft
body. The painted colours melt into the glaze
in its final firing and produce that mellow effect
so much esteemed by connoisseurs of old porcelain.
It is peculiarly English, and stands unique in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
having technical assets not possessed by any
other porcelain. This is something great to
record to the honour of the English potter in his
mastery of technique.</p>

<p><b>The New Ceramic Art.</b>&mdash;The eighteenth century,
in spite of the wars which shook the kingdoms
of Europe to their foundations, showed a singular
enthusiasm for the art of the potter. A reference
to a table of the factory marks of European porcelain
of that period will disclose the fact that
most of the leading factories were under the
auspices of royal or noble patrons whose arms or
monograms were incorporated in the mark of the
factory.</p>

<p>Kings, princes, electors, grand dukes, and margraves
vied with each other in producing rival
ware. The St. Petersburg factory had the cipher
of the Emperor Paul. At Weesp, in Holland,
Count Gronsveldt-Diepenbroek's factory, the works
were handed over to the direction of a Protestant
pastor. From Vienna with the mark of the
Austrian arms, to La Haye with the design of
the stork, the symbol of the city; from the arms
of the Archbishop of Mayence and the cross and
initials of the Prince Bishop of Fulda, to the
design of Lille, the <i>Manufacture Royale de Monseigneur
le Dauphin</i> with the crowned dolphin,
a bewildering entanglement of royal marks and
patrician ciphers is studded on china, to the
confusion of collectors, adding zest to the art of
the connoisseur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p><b>The Great Secret.</b>&mdash;The actual discovery of
the composition of true porcelain by B√∂ttger is
interwoven with romance, and the betrayal of
the secret processes of its manufacture at Meissen
to the leading factories of Europe is a record
filled with stirring incidents of the most piquant
character. The story of young B√∂ttger, the
alchemist and inventor, is told in full by Professor
Ernst Zimmermann, Keeper of the Royal
Porcelain Collection at Dresden, <i>Die Erfindung
und Fr√ºhzeit des Meissner Porzellans</i>, Berlin,
1908. The search for the philosopher's stone
to transmute baser metals into gold had fascinated
all chemists. B√∂ttger was credited with more
knowledge than he possessed, and he hastily
quitted Berlin to avoid the too assiduous attentions
of the King of Prussia. For years he
wandered in Saxony, and finally claimed protection
in 1701 from Frederick Augustus, Elector
of Saxony. His life at the laboratory at Meissen,
under Ehrenfried Walter von Tschirnhaus, who
was a distinguished scientific scholar, was that
of a guarded prisoner with a wonderful secret.
Tschirnhaus, who was a good chemist, established
a glass furnace and invented an ingenious burning
mirror, and had essayed to make porcelain. But
on the assumption that it was a vitrification,
his results only led him to the production of a
milky glass. A specimen of this <i>milch glass</i> is
in the Japanese Palace at Dresden.</p>

<p>When Charles XII of Sweden invaded Saxony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
B√∂ttger and his workmen were hurried off to
the impregnable fortress of K√∂nigstein, where a
laboratory was erected. A year later he was back
at Meissen conducting experiments and cheerfully
exhorting the workmen. In 1709 he produced
his true hard porcelain from natural earth
obtained from Aue, near Schneeberg.</p>

<p>The most elaborate precautions were taken at
Meissen to prevent the secret becoming known.
The earth was delivered in sealed casks. It
was in vain that an oath was exacted from each
workman and written on the walls&mdash;"Silence
until death" (<i>Geheim bis ins grab</i>). The punishment
for betrayal was incarceration as a State
prisoner in the fortress of K√∂nigsberg for life.
The terrible silent conditions of the labour produced
a longing on the part of the immured
workmen to escape. And escape they did.</p>

<p><b>The Secret divulged.</b>&mdash;In 1718, the year previous
to B√∂ttger's death Stolzel, the chief
workman at Meissen, made his way to Vienna
and proceeded to establish, under the direction
of a Belgian named Claude Du Pasquier, a manufactory
of hard porcelain. The factory was
acquired for the State by the Empress Maria
Theresa in 1744.</p>

<p>From Vienna a workman named Ringler carried
the secret far and wide. His name is linked
with the founding of several factories&mdash;at H√∂chst
in 1740, at Frankenthal in 1754, where he became
director, at Nymphenberg in 1756, where his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
aid was invoked, at Ludwigsberg (in W√ºrtemberg)
in 1758, and at Zurich in 1759.</p>

<p>The workmen of H√∂chst, in their turn, further
divulged the secret. Bengraf, in 1750, carried
the process to F√ºrstenberg, the factory under
the patronage of the Duke of Brunswick.</p>

<p>In 1744 an imperial china factory was established
at St. Petersburg by the Empress Elizabeth
Petrowna, who employed workmen from Meissen,
and in 1765, under the patronage of the Empress
Catherine II, the works were enlarged.</p>

<p>There were two methods of obtaining the great
secret of Meissen&mdash;by stealth and by experiment;
most of the factories employed the former means.
The attempts to arrive at the hard paste by experiment
resulted in the establishment of many
soft-paste factories. One remarkable instance
of indefatigable industry is that of the chemist
Pott, in the employ of the King of Prussia at
Berlin, who endeavoured honestly to arrive at
the nature of the composition of the Meissen
body. He is credited with having made no
fewer than thirty thousand experiments, and in
so doing he contributed largely to the modern
chemical knowledge of the effect of high temperatures
on minerals.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

p. 598.</p></div>

<p>It is thus seen how great was the discovery of B√∂ttger, of Meissen, and
how far-reaching were the results of the manufacture of true porcelain
in Saxony. A wild burst of enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span> followed which has been rarely
equalled. Soldier-princes engaged in the wars which were waged in the
German States turned aside to indulge in speculation concerning the
new art. In 1717 about a hundred and fifty pieces of fine porcelain,
many of them old Oriental, now at the Japanese Palace at Dresden, were
acquired by Augustus the Strong of Saxony from the King of Prussia in
exchange for a regiment of dragoons, without uniforms, horses, or arms.</p>

<p>When the vigilant Frederick the Great commenced
the Seven Years' War, and on a sudden
filled the electorate of Saxony with sixty thousand
Prussian troops, Dresden was taken. It was
in vain that the Queen of Poland, daughter of
an emperor and mother-in-law of a dauphin,
placed the secret State documents in her bedroom
to avoid seizure. They were too valuable to
Frederick, who had them forcibly removed, and
by publishing them proved that he was to be
assailed at once by Austria, France, Russia,
Sweden, Saxony, and the Germanic body.</p>

<p>The factory of Meissen was depleted of material
and models, and he transported artists and workmen
to Berlin to found his factory there. Five
hundred persons were engaged at this new factory,
and in order to win commercial success he executed
a master-stroke by framing a decree that all Jews
in his kingdom must produce a voucher from the
director of the factory that they had purchased
a certain amount of the royal porcelain before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
permission would be granted to enable them to
marry.</p>

<p>It is such human touches as these, significant
in their piquancy, which give exceptional interest
to the porcelain of the old days produced in conditions
of no little difficulty. Under Court patronage,
beset by espionage and hedged about by
intrigue, the secret of one factory rapidly found
its way across the frontier to the neighbouring
State. The fortunes of potters have not lain
in smooth places, and fate has been as capricious
as the fire of the furnace. In eighteenth-century
days the <i>furore</i> of mad dilettantism pursued them
relentlessly. Royal amateurs more often than
not asked them to make bricks without straw,
and there was still in the air the lingering suspicion
that the furnace might yield up the secret
of the philosopher's stone and fill the State treasury
to the full.</p>

<p><b>The First Porcelain in Denmark.</b>&mdash;It is not
difficult to imagine the situation. King Frederik V
determined to found a porcelain factory of his
own. His queen consort was Louise, daughter
of George II, who died in 1751, eight years after
her marriage. His second wife was Juliane Marie,
of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel.</p>

<p class="center">Fournier period (1760-1766).<br />Soft-paste Porcelain.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Faience was made at various factories in Denmark, and it is more
than conjectural that various native attempts were made to produce
porcelain. The royal factory, which the king built near the Blue Tower
at Christianshavn, with the aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span> of foreign workmen whom he had induced
to enter his service, commenced to make various experiments. Mehlhorn
was one of the alien potters brought from Saxony, but apparently,
whether from paucity of natural earths or owing to faulty kilns,
nothing of any moment resulted until Louis Fournier, a Frenchman
(1760-1766), was induced to take charge of the factory. During what is
known as the Fournier period the French director had the assistance
of Danish artists, including Johannes Wiedewelt the sculptor. His
contemporaries speak of the services he designed. Doubtless many of
them were intended as presents to foreign princes and ambassadors, and
found their way into royal and foreign cabinets. Although only about
twenty pieces of the Fournier period are known, it is not impossible
that careful research may discover that some of the early pieces
attributed to F√ºrstenberg may really belong to Fournier of Copenhagen.
Obviously, on account of their rarity they are of great value and
of exceptional interest as being the first creations of the Royal
Copenhagen Porcelain Factory. The identification should be rendered the
easier when it is borne in mind that the early Copenhagen porcelain of
the Fournier period is soft paste, whereas the F√ºrstenberg porcelain is
hard paste. The mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span> F with the figure 5 stands for Frederik V and not
for Fournier. The coincidence of the initial letter is like the W in
Worcester porcelain of the Dr. Wall period.</p>

<p>The early creations of the Copenhagen factory
were porcelain, it is true, but they are not the
hard or true porcelain of Meissen. They are
the soft paste of the same nature as the <i>p√¢te
tendre</i> of contemporary S√®vres. They did not
attain the high ideal contemplated by Frederik V
when he set out to equal the Saxon porcelain
and the other hard-paste porcelains of Germany,
but they arrived at a dignity and a grace of style
which are worthy of regard. As first attempts they
are of surprising beauty, and the few specimens
remaining arouse curiosity as to what masterpieces
of this short period have been lost to posterity.</p>

<p>The modelling, the design, and the colouring
of such early examples as these of a new factory
are naturally dependent on prototypes. It was
a great thing to produce porcelain at all, consequently
the style is found to be derivative. A
fine S√®vres jar with cover, in date 1761, at the
S√®vres Museum, has a family likeness to the
Fournier cups with covers in Rosenborg Castle,
Copenhagen. Although these latter have the
same type of decoration with a white panel on
a dark ground, it will be seen that the S√®vres
example exhibits the sure mastery of technique
of an older factory. The painting is richer and
of more detail, with birds of tropical plumage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
The Fournier examples, with handles, were evidently
designed for use. There are five of these
covered custard cups at Rosenborg Castle, three
having green and two having blue grounds; we
illustrate an example. At the <i>Kunstindustri
Museum</i> at Copenhagen there are two custard
cups and covers of similar form&mdash;one with red
decoration; and the other with red and green,
and floral decoration painted in colours. These
are both marked F5 in blue.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note, in the archives of the
S√®vres factory, that Louis XV sent, in 1758, to
the King of Denmark a service of green, decorated
with figures, flowers, and birds, which cost 30,000
livres. Here, at hand, was a fine S√®vres service
as model for Fournier, and the resemblance of
soft-paste Copenhagen porcelain to S√®vres is not
difficult to understand.</p>

<p>In the illustration of the <i>Oval Dish and Cover</i>
standing beside the cup with handle, the ware is
coarser and in paste and colouring is not unlike
some of the earlier specimens of Bow china. These
and the other illustration of <i>Sucrier with Cover
and Dish</i> are from the famous collection at Rosenborg
Castle. The sucrier and cover are decorated
with scale pattern; portions of the outer rim
are moulded in relief and the floral decoration
is in natural colours.</p>

<p>A <i>Teapot</i> from a tea service at the National
Museum at Stockholm exhibits a similar style
in this experimental period. The colours of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
teapot, cream jug, and cups and saucers are
emerald green borders with gilding. The flowers
are painted in natural colours. They bear the
Fournier mark F5 in gold. The service was a
present to King Charles XV of Sweden from the
Countess Dannemand.</p>

<p>In the collection of Count Moltke of Bregentved
are four fine <i>Vases</i> of this period. They exhibit
the rococo style then prevalent and are remarkable
works emanating from the little royal factory
of Copenhagen during the first years of its existence.
On one of these vases is a panel decorated
with a group of Cupids supporting a shield upon
which is inscribed the mark used by Fournier
in the period of Frederik V.</p>

<p>All these soft-paste Copenhagen examples are
of great rarity. The Fournier period was of
short duration. The death of Frederik V, in
1766, removed its royal patron. The winter of
1766-7 brought great distress in Copenhagen,
and the masked balls and masquerades and the
luxurious riot of the Court of the young king
Christian VII at Christianborg inflamed public
opinion against the new monarch.</p>

<p>It is obvious that at such a juncture the royal
factory, which in its struggling infancy needed
enthusiastic patronage, suffered from neglect so
that it is not surprising to find that its days were
numbered, and after a vain struggle it finally
ceased work. Louis Fournier returned to France,
and the first period of Copenhagen porcelain came
to an end.</p>

range of subjects.</p>


<p>At the death of King Frederik V, in January
1766, and the succession of Christian VII, then
seventeen years of age, the royal china factory
at the Blue Tower fell upon evil days. When
Frantz Heinrich M√ºller, "only after numerous
unsuccessful attempts," presented his first three
pieces of hard-fired transparent porcelain to the
young king in September 1773, there were matters
of much graver moment occupying public attention.
It was almost in vain that M√ºller had built new
kilns differing from those in which soft porcelain
was made, travelled to Bornholm to find suitable
clay, and experimented with glazes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>In the six years since the death of Frederik,
Denmark had passed through one of the most
tragical periods of her history. Christian VII, a
manikin prince, became the sport of fate. Caroline
Matilda, the sister of George III of England, at
the early age of fifteen, became his queen. Himself
the son of the beloved Louise, daughter of
George II, great hopes were entertained by the
Danish people of the alliance. But perverse
circumstances&mdash;with the grim figure of the
Dowager Queen Juliane Marie in the background&mdash;beset
the path of the young couple.</p>

<p>The Court at Christianborg, an echo of Versailles,
filled with painted men and women who
affected to despise Danish customs and even the
Danish tongue, was a hot-bed of intrigue.
Christian threw etiquette to the winds in his
sanctum, surrounded by boon companions. The
coterie had all the abandon of Sans Souci without
the master-mind of Frederick of Prussia and the
wit and satire of that monarch's <i>confidantes</i>.
Madame de Plessen, lady-in-waiting, stern precisian
in etiquette, devoted to her young mistress,
but heedlessly tactless, made a breach between
the king and queen. The bride of a year retired
to the company of staid dowagers and played
chess. The petulance and malicious tricks of the
king early showed that, unable to govern himself,
he was unable to govern others. Madame de
Plessen was dismissed by the king and ordered to
leave Denmark. Christian's dissipation was rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
becoming a public scandal. The "Northern
Rogue" was the mild epithet of the English
populace, who cheered the little king when he
came to St. James's. Echoes of his wild life
reached Matilda at Copenhagen.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>A Great Court Scandal.</b>&mdash;At this juncture a
remarkable man, John Frederick Struensee, the
king's physician, a German, possessed of extraordinary
talents, gradually began to assume control
of State affairs. The tragic story is too intricate
to refer to here in more than a cursory manner.
Queen Matilda's attachment to Struensee is as
romantic as that of Mary Queen of Scots for
Rizzio. An English author has termed her "A
Queen of Tears."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is Madame de Genlis who
affirms that "men summon physicians only when
they suffer, women when they are merely afflicted
with <i>ennui</i>." In six years this man became the
most powerful in Denmark. An amazing state of
things followed. The envoys of the various
Powers became alarmed at the situation. Drastic
reforms followed one another in quick succession,
inaugurated by Struensee, but promulgated in the
king's name. Undoubtedly Struensee had a genius
for government had he tempered his reforms with
discretion. He was saturated with German philosophy,
and based his ethics on Voltaire and the
sordid sentiment of Rousseau. "It is the path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
of the passions that has conducted me to philosophy,"
writes Jean-Jacques, and Struensee might
well have applauded that sentiment. He invented
a new office and became "Master of Requests"
and virtually Prime Minister. But he offended too
many people's interests and became the object of
hatred. He galled the old nobility by his despotic
power, and the Dowager-Queen Juliane Marie,
from her seclusion at Fredensborg, filled the Court
with spies. The weak-minded king, now showing
signs of mental aberration, signed everything put
before him, and the young Queen Matilda was
under the domination of Struensee, who openly
treated her with disrespect.</p>

Norway, and Princess of Great Britain and Ireland</i>, by W. H.
Wilkins, M.A., F.S.A. (2 vols.), London, 1904.</p></div>

<p>In 1771 there was great distress in the country
and discontent was growing. Scurrilous letters
fell at the feet of Struensee and Matilda on their
walks at Hirscholm, and placards of a threatening
nature were affixed to the walls of the royal
palaces. Struensee had flouted the army by
attempting to disband the Guards. The mutterings
of disaffection became more audible. His
effrontery deserted him. He grew craven-hearted
in face of grave dangers. His failure stamps him
as a colossal adventurer at bottom; had he been
of sterner stuff he might have become a hero.</p>

<p><b>A Coup d'Etat.</b>&mdash;The hour for striking a blow
was at hand, and Queen Juliane Marie and her
son Frederik, with a band of conspirators, at a
masked ball on the night of January 16, 1772,
seized the person of the king, together with Matilda;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
the latter was hurried off to the fortress of Kronborg,
and Struensee and Brandt, his coadjutor,
were imprisoned in the citadel at Copenhagen.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>At Rosenborg Castle, Copenhagen.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The trial and divorce of Matilda and the
beheading of Struensee and Brandt is a poignant
story. The name of the unfortunate young
queen was ordered to be officially omitted from
the prayer-book at a time when she surely stood
most in need of prayer. Juliane Marie pursued
Matilda with vindictiveness, and her malevolence
nearly precipitated Denmark in a war with England.
It was intended that Matilda should be
imprisoned in a remote fortress in Jutland. The
British Minister, Sir Robert Murray Keith, informed
the Danish Government that unless Queen
Matilda was released he would present his letters
of recall and war would be declared. The Danish
Minister in London wrote in great haste to say
that a fleet was fitting out. It was only then
that Queen Juliane Marie released her hold of
Matilda and allowed her to depart to Celle, in the
State of Hanover, where she died in 1775 in her
twenty-third year.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the state of affairs when M√ºller
was experimenting with his clays, his glazes, and
his colours. In 1771 a hundred and fifty weavers
set out on foot from Copenhagen to Hirscholm,
in days of panic, to complain that they were
starving because the royal silk factory was closed.
It was an ill-starred venture to attempt the
establishment of a new porcelain factory, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
face of reverses of fortune and undeterred by
lack of support, M√ºller by his immense energy
fired into being the great porcelain factory of
Copenhagen. To M√ºller the Dane belongs the
honour of founding the little factory which strove
to achieve results no less beautiful than Meissen,
Berlin, or S√®vres. Begun in a spirit of worthy
emulation, the Copenhagen factory shortly began
to develop an original and national style, in spite
of the fact that it worked in the early days on
foreign suggestion and employed foreign artists.</p>

<p><b>The Inception of the Porcelain Factory.</b>&mdash;Frantz
Heinrich M√ºller was born on the 17th of
November 1732. When an apprentice, from the
age of fifteen, at the Kong Salomon's Pharmacy
at Copenhagen, he devoted his leisure to the
study of chemistry, botany, mineralogy, and
metallurgy. He was appointed as Guardian of
the Mint at the Bank of Copenhagen in his twenty-eighth
year, and held the post from 1760 to 1767.
As early as 1765 he had the object in view of
establishing a porcelain factory; together with a
painter named Richter we find him soliciting
support. In common with his contemporaries
he cast eager eyes on foreign porcelain. He
wandered for three years on the Continent under
an assumed name, and the unravelling of this
period of his career would throw much light on
his researches.</p>

</div></div>

<p>M√ºller, on his secret mission in Germany, found
that the china factories of F√ºrstenberg, Meissen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
and Berlin were closed to him. But he threw
his whole life and energy into his work. He outlived
the opposition of the Society of Apothecaries,
who objected to a licence being granted him as
a druggist and dispenser. But in face of the
objection the College of Medicine found the
applicant "a very capable, learned, and experienced
man, not only in Pharmacy, but also in
Chemistry, Assaying, and Natural History." With
characteristic energy he passed the pharmaceutical
examination at the age of forty-one; already
he had shown originality and inventiveness by
making several discoveries in colours and in
dyeing. But with all his virility he found financial
success no easy matter at such a disturbed
period. He endeavoured to form a company
for the manufacture of Danish porcelain. To
his chagrin, only one share was sold.</p>

<p>At the outset there was little promise that his
untiring efforts would win the remotest recognition
from his countrymen. It seemed imminent
that the whole enterprise would have to be abandoned.
Happily, Privy Chancellor Holm, the
private secretary to the Dowager-Queen Juliane
Marie, saw possibilities in the venture. To
revive the old factory which Fournier had vacated
was an opportunity not to be missed. If it
proved a success, it would redound to the credit
of the queen and add lustre to the new <i>r√©gime</i>
just commenced under the sway of Juliane Marie,
with Guldberg as the power behind the throne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
Christian VII had simply passed as a signer of
documents into the keeping of another set of
masters.</p>

<p>Of the shares, most of them in the new factory
were held by members of the royal family and
one by M√ºller himself. The directors were Holm;
Suhm, the historian; General Eickstedt, one of
the conspirators who took a leading part in the
arrest at the masked ball; and Guldberg, who
had a finger in every pie. On the 13th of March
1775 the company obtained the monopoly of the
manufacture of porcelain in all the dominions of
the King of Denmark, in spite of the opposition
of the Board of Trade.</p>

<p><b>The Origin of the Mark of the Three Blue Lines.</b>&mdash;The
first meeting of the company was held on
the 1st of May 1775. It was decided that the
trade-mark of the factory, according to the proposal
of Queen Juliane Marie, should be three
wavy lines, always marked in blue, representing
Denmark's three waterways&mdash;<i>Oresund</i>, and the
two belts: <i>Storebelt</i>, between Sjaelland and Fyen;
<i>Lillebelt</i>, between Fyen and Jutland. With this
trade-mark of the three blue lines the Copenhagen
factory (<i>Den Danske Porcell√¶nsfabrik</i>) took its
place beside the older factories on the Continent,
and to this day, a hundred and forty-three years
afterwards, this same mark appears on all porcelain
emanating from the Royal Copenhagen Factory.</p>

<p>Although M√ºller only had one share of the subscribed capital,
there was only one controlling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span> brain. He worked the enterprise
single-handedly. It was "<i>par ses seules lumi√®res</i>," to quote a
contemporary French account of the factory, that he had succeeded in
producing the beautiful porcelain which won early recognition from
connoisseurs. But the Court were not eager to encourage ambition. After
the late startling exhibition of a now defunct medico, whose head
still stuck on a pole on Gallows Hill, genius must needs be rigorously
safeguarded. In common, therefore, with his artisans, M√ºller was
required to sign a contract binding him to remain in the employ of the
Court factory, and to keep secret all that he knew of the manufacture
of porcelain&mdash;his own invention. His official position was only that of
works manager.</p>

<p>Genius, that indomitable and unquenchable
spirit which overrides all obstacles, found M√ºller,
with his crowd of untried soldier workmen and
crude apprentices, ceaselessly working in the
factory from five in the morning till seven in the
evening, and often superintending the firing all
night. In 1776 three workmen were inveigled
from Meissen to the Court factory at Copenhagen,
but only two out of the three showed any ability.
Their supercilious manners, together with their
higher wages, brought trouble in the factory
among the other workmen, and M√ºller expelled
them by force. But he made one appointment
which undoubtedly was of benefit to the factory;
by contributing part of the salary himself, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
brought A. C. Luplau from the F√ºrstenberg
factory, who became modelling master. As early
as 1776 the name of Ba√øer appears as a painter
in colours, as opposed to the painters in underglaze
blue. It was Ba√øer who afterwards was
entrusted with the painting of the celebrated
<i>Flora Danica</i> service, begun in 1790. Others
whose names are found in the early records are
Hans Clio and the portrait painters, Camrath and
Ondrup.</p>

<p>The first four years of the factory were very
critical. Notwithstanding the close application
of M√ºller, the financial position came to a serious
crisis in 1779. There seemed every likelihood
that the factory would follow in the steps of
Fournier and close its doors. How the royal
shareholders adjusted matters is not known, nor
what became of M√ºller's one share in the enterprise.
The debts were paid in the king's name,
and the factory was taken over by the State and
became the Royal Porcelain Manufactory (<i>Den
Kongelige Porcell√¶nsfabrik</i>), which name it bears
at the present day. In March 1780 a retail
business was opened at Copenhagen in connection
with the factory. M√ºller was made inspector
of the factory and the title of Councillor of Justice
was conferred upon him.</p>

<p>Dated specimens have an exceptional interest
in proving that no inconsiderable progress had
at that time been made in the artistic development
of the factory. Already in form and in decoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
there was something distinctive in M√ºller's ware.
Such pieces show indisputably that great days
were at hand, if indeed in these first few years
success had not already been achieved in training
artists and craftsmen in the new industry.</p>

<p><b>M√ºller's Technique.</b>&mdash;Danish ceramic art is
profoundly indebted to M√ºller for his pioneer
work. He was a giant in days when pigmies
controlled the destinies. His unflagging energy,
his practical experiments, and his original and
inventive genius impelled him to implant national
characteristics in the Royal Copenhagen porcelain
which have never departed from the ware of this
factory. His first attempts were made with
kaolin which he obtained from the island of
Bornholm. He soon realized that this did not
fulfil all the conditions necessary for a fine body.
It was of a greyish-blue tint, and was liable to
lose its shape in firing. In appearance it is not
very transparent and is somewhat coarse, like
some of the old Japanese porcelain. Of this
Bornholm period mention will be made later in
dealing with the early examples of blue underglaze
painted ware, which is a special variety by
itself, running concurrently with the overglaze
painted ware which M√ºller brought in his best
period to unexampled perfection.</p>

<p>He prepared the glazes himself, determined
the correct method of firing, and made the colours
used at the factory. The blue that he invented
is perfect, and is to be found on the early specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
of underglaze painted porcelain for domestic use.
The green and the purple found in the early M√ºller
period were his own discovery and of exceptional
quality in tone. He was a master of technique,
and perfected a new body which he called "virgin
paste." This is of a dazzling white, and M√ºller's
glaze is transparent and smooth as polished
crystal. The tint is that of the green of the
sea, and without doubt its technical excellence
lends great beauty to the porcelain of this period.
Considering the primitive methods of working
and the impure materials then available, the
perfection and beauty of the results claim profound
admiration from the connoisseur. Even
with the aid of modern technology and chemistry
it has not yet been found possible to equal the
technique of M√ºller's best period.</p>

<p>The year 1780, the date when the first opening of the retail business
took place, was the turning-point in the history of the factory. M√ºller
was acclaimed as a genius by his countrymen. It was proposed that a
statue should be erected to his honour&mdash;and this in his lifetime. A
wave of enthusiasm found an outlet in Latin poems to "the man who had
done so much for his king and country." It is exceptional to find such
contemporary honour bestowed on a potter. Rarely is a man a prophet in
his own country. But happily M√ºller lived to wear the laurel wreath.
"What honour," writes a contemporary, "this industry has brought its
founder! I was enraptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span> with the things which I saw. How could I
have dreamed that these could be made by a Dane and in my native land!"</p>

</div></div>

<p>We catch an insight into M√ºller's methods from
a letter he wrote, when eighty years of age, to
Boye, a subsequent director, who had suggested
the use of some pieces of new apparatus for the
laboratory. Old M√ºller wrote as follows: "I
fail to see the use or necessity of the thermometer,
eudiometer, or hydrometer. I have never
found it necessary to apply such exact learning
in the manufacture of porcelain, and ideas
such as these appear to me to be absolutely
absurd." While allowance must be made for
M√ºller's advanced age and his hypersensitiveness
towards his successors, it is of great interest to
speculate upon his point of view. Man of science
that he was, his deprecatory regard for these
instruments seems to denote that his technique
was arrived at by practical rule-of-thumb methods,
dependent upon personal exactitude rather than
upon formul√¶. It is idle to scoff at M√ºller's
conservatism, for science has yet to unravel the
secret of the lost art of tempering the Damascene
blade and the subtleties of the potter's art of
the K'ang Hsi period in the single coloured
glazes, <i>la qualit√© ma√Ætresse de la c√©ramique</i>, the
delicacies of the rare <i>peau de p√™che</i>, the <i>famille
rose</i>, and the <i>famille verte</i>. In the late seventeenth
and early eighteenth-century days the methods
of Chinese potters were as unscientific as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
defended by M√ºller, but the results are "not of
an age, but for all time." And M√ºller's results
stand the test of intense criticism; they are
hitherto inimitable.</p>

<p><b>M√ºller's Range of Subjects.</b>&mdash;In regard to the periods of the
various styles of M√ºller, with very few data to guide the critic it
must be largely a matter of conjecture as to the exact chronological
order of their manufacture. It seems to the present writer, in
endeavouring to classify the examples, that they naturally fall under
the following heads. One class overlaps another in point of time, and
although at first, in the experimental period, elaborate artistic
creations cannot at that stage have been attempted, it must equally
follow that in the middle and later period the simpler and utilitarian
forms were still being made concurrently with the finer works of art.</p>

<p>The natural order of development in point of
technique would be:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(<i>At the National Museum, Stockholm.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is obvious that in the immature years of a
pottery figure subjects would be rarely attempted
until such time as the potters were sure of their
ground and the technique had been securely
established. The highest artistic achievements
must necessarily come after the rudiments of the
art have been mastered. In regard to figure
subjects, the fact that Luplau came to Copenhagen
in 1776 with eighteen years' experience from the
F√ºrstenberg factory must be taken into consideration
in regard to the appearance, at an earlier
stage than usual in the history of a factory, of
figures of excellent character. But at the same
time it must be borne in mind that the utilitarian
blue-and-white services, the national Danish
pattern now so well known, were made simultaneously
with such fine creations as the elaborate
royal services at Rosenborg Castle and elsewhere.</p>

<p>All through the periods from M√ºller onwards
the famous blue-and-white has remained as a
standard output; but as a rough generalization,
with the reservation admitted in regard to figures,
it may be said that the classes above mentioned
followed one another in quick succession, until
the climax of the M√ºller period was reached, when
the Royal Copenhagen Factory worthily claimed
a place beside the great factories in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The masterpieces of M√ºller come, as do all <i>chefs-d'≈ìuvres</i>, as a
surprise. Their gracefulness and poetic charm are captivating. To
those who have never had the opportunity to examine a fine collection
of old Copenhagen porcelain the discovery of these works of art is a
revelation. It has hitherto been supposed that the productions of the
little Danish factory were only imitative of the works of the older and
better-known German factories. But to the most superficial observer
it is at once evident that here is something at once national and
beautiful.</p>

<p>During the ten years subsequent to the opening
of the retail establishment in Copenhagen, the
output of the factory must have been very extensive.
It is interesting to find that in 1790
the Custom House regulations relative to the
subject are as follows: "Foreign china is prohibited,
because the manufactory at Copenhagen,
which is at the charge of the State, has been of
late productive enough to supply the two kingdoms
with an article of luxury, more than of
necessity. Painted earthenware is likewise prohibited,
from its resemblance to china being so
great that many may be induced to purchase it
instead of a more valuable article; but plain
earthenware, being more generally necessary, is
allowed, as is also the porcelain brought over
by the East India ships belonging to the Asiatic
Company."</p>

<p><b>A Contemporary Account of the Factory.</b>&mdash;The
testimony of two foreign critics who visited the
factory in 1790 is a valuable record, as they produced
authoritative statistical volumes on Northern
Europe. Their opinion assists the modern student
in forming an estimate of the relative value of
the Royal Copenhagen porcelain as compared
with that of the great contemporary factories,
especially Meissen. In <i>Les Voyages de deux
Fran√ßois dans le Nord de l'Europe</i> (the Chevalier
Louis de Boisgelin and the Comte Alfonse de
Fortia), published by the latter, the trade and
manufactures of Denmark receive full treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>We quote from the English edition, <i>Travels
through Denmark and Sweden: to which is prefixed
a Journal of a Voyage down the Elbe from
Dresden to Hamburgh, including a compendious
historical account of the Hanseatic League, by
Louis de Boisgelin, Knight of Malta, with views
from drawings taken on the spot by Dr. Charles
Parry</i>. This was published in two quarto volumes
in 1810. The author states that the former
volume written by his fellow-traveller is so rare
that it is hardly possible to procure a copy
"either of the original edition or of the counterfeit
one produced in Germany."</p>

<p>The details in regard to the factory as it then
existed are very interesting. There were three
large and two small ovens; one of these was the
first employed by M√ºller when he produced his
hard porcelain. The ovens were of brick. A
firing lasted eighteen hours. It took four days
to cool. "These ovens are capable of firing
eight complete services at once, whereas those
of Saxony cannot take in more than three. The
fire here is so well distributed that in many of
the firings of fine porcelain the loss sustained is
scarcely more than ten rix-dollars."</p>

<p>After describing the process of glazing, the
writer proceeds to describe the most important
operation of all, performed in a room "where
there is only one man, who takes an oath to have
no communication whatsoever with any other
workman. He works a mill by hand in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
he prepares the paste, and mixes the different
matters which compose the glaze." Of the mills
for grinding there were two. The granite came
from Zealand; "the black is of no use for this
operation, which is not performed in the same
manner as in Saxony, where the matter is mixed
without water, but here it is quite the contrary.
By the method employed in this country there
is as much made in two hours as they can possibly
produce in Saxony in twenty-four; besides the
advantage of having no occasion for sieves."</p>

<p>A contemporary account such as this by competent
observers who had visited other porcelain
factories in Europe and came with the definite
object of finding out as much as possible, is of
supreme importance as a document. It appears
that the blue which came from Norway was
considered the finest. There was an immense
loft for "coffins," or cases, to be stored for a year
before being ready for use. These were made
from Bornholm clay, and were used in the ovens
as "saggers," as the term is in English pottery,
to contain the porcelain. "The moulds are made
of a kind of plaster which comes from France.
This," says the narrative, "is the only foreign
article employed in the manufactory."</p>

<p>In regard to the overglaze colours used there
are some interesting facts. Yellow is made from
pure tin; purple, with tin and gold; dark poppy,
with iron; sky-blue, with cobalt; black, with
manganese; rose-colour, with gold; and green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
with copper. "These colours never change in
firing, but remain precisely as they were first
drawn; whereas they spread in many other
factories."</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that the travellers were comparing
the manufactures of one country with
another in their precise records, which excited
European interest in regard to their statistic
and economic value, the praise of the Royal
Copenhagen porcelain makes the more pleasant
reading. "The Copenhagen porcelain is less
glassy than that of China. The paste of the
biscuit is lighter and closer than that of the Saxon
porcelain, the white keeps its colour better, and
it is easier to wash. In short, the whole of this
manufacture is perfectly well understood, and
carried on with great spirit and diligence. It
has only been established thirteen years, and at
the end of four the storehouses were already
filled with a variety of articles. We saw some
flutes, for which they asked seventy rix-dollars
each. These are very just in tune, but too heavy
to be played upon conveniently; they are likewise
astonishingly brittle. We were also shown
vases two and a half feet high most beautifully
painted by Camrath."</p>

<p>The writer makes one extraordinary statement,
which goes to show that the finest works were
made for rich people, and were not seen by the
Danish people in general. "The Copenhagen
porcelain is very little known even in Denmark;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
for the original expenses of a manufacture of this
nature are such, that it must necessarily be sold
very dear: it is indeed more so at present than
the Saxon china; but it is imagined the price
will be lowered in a short time."</p>

<p>The number of workmen employed at the
factory at the time of this inspection was three
hundred, "forty of whom were for the painting
part of the business, which we thought but few
for that important branch."</p>

<p>In regard to the director, M√ºller, himself, some
trenchant criticisms are made as to the poor
recognition the State had given to so great a
potter. In other factories there were different
directors, one for the body and glaze, another
for the ovens and firing, a third for the artistic
form, and a fourth for the painting and gilding,
all of whom were paid at a high rate. "But
here M. M√ºller, an excellent chemist, acts himself
in these various departments, and is very
shabbily paid, having only a salary of 500 rix-dollars.
He is also the original inventor of this
manufacture, and when it is known that he was
never out of Copenhagen, and consequently could
have had no model to go by, it is inconceivable
to what a degree of perfection he has brought it,
and that, too, entirely from his own enlightened
genius, without the smallest foreign assistance."</p>

</div></div>

<p>Concerning the salary of M√ºller of 500 rix-dollars
per annum, it is noteworthy to observe
that at that time the retail price in Copenhagen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
of a complete afternoon service, consisting of six
chocolate cups with handles, twelve coffee cups,
coffee-pot, teapot and dish, sugar dish, tea caddy
and cream jug, was 19 rix-dollars 3 marks
first quality blue-and-white, and 26 rix-dollars
4 marks painted with natural flowers. M√ºller's
yearly labours were evidently reckoned as only
worth a score of such afternoon services. Hence
the piquant strictures of the foreign noblemen.</p>

<p>The point raised as to M√ºller not having had
the smallest foreign assistance may be dismissed
as somewhat erroneous. There was Anton Carl
Luplau, who was at the F√ºrstenberg factory for
eighteen years, and who came to Copenhagen
in 1776; Johan Christoph Ba√øer, who was
born in Nuremberg, and came to Copenhagen
in 1768, when he was thirty years old; Peter
Heinrich Benjamin Lehmann, who was a native
of Hamburg, and came to Copenhagen from the
Berlin factory in 1780, and was naturalized
in 1781; Carl Fridrich Thomaschefsky, who
worked a short time at the factory; and Martin
Cadewitz, who served eleven years and died in
1791. But in 1781, of two hundred persons
employed at the factory only ten were foreigners.</p>

<p>As to whether M√ºller ever left Copenhagen
the Count de Boisgelin adds a footnote: "According
to M. Catteau, this was not the fact; we only
repeat what the man told us was the case." The
work referred to is <i>Le Tableau des Etats Dannois
envisag√©s sous le Rapport du M√©canisme Social,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
par Jean Pierre Catteau</i>, printed in Paris in 1802
in three volumes.</p>

<p>It is rather an interesting point, but the evidence
is against de Boisgelin, for M√ºller not only
visited Brunswick when he entered into negotiations
with Luplau to enter the Danish service,
but at a slightly earlier date he made a tour of
the German factories&mdash;in an assumed name, as
some accounts go. That he made good use of
his time is amply borne out by the results he
achieved in so short a space of time on his return
to his native land.</p>

<p>There is nothing to detract from the originality
and inventiveness of his work. The personality
of his genius illuminates the work of the factory.
He experienced as many reverses of fortune as
did Bernard Palissy, and battled against adverse
circumstances with no less indomitable spirit.
He conquered technical difficulties, and experimented
with clays and bodies and glazes and
pigments with hardly less assiduity than did
Josiah Wedgwood.</p>

<p><b>A National Style Created.</b>&mdash;No art is wholly
independent in origin or of sporadic growth. In
the early days and the initial stages it must
always be derivative. In ceramic art this applies
either to form or decoration, often to both. The
form and decoration of Chinese blue-and-white
porcelain was the basis of the school of Delft
faience. The scale pattern and the panel with
exotic birds were slavishly adopted at S√®vres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
from Oriental prototypes. Similarly the older
European factories impressed their styles upon
factories of a later growth. The crowd of German
factories came under the direct influence of Meissen
in design as well as in technique. It is a significant
fact that Copenhagen porcelain under M√ºller's
guiding spirit developed an original style from the
first establishment of the factory. This achievement
should be placed to M√ºller's credit in determining
his position among European potters.
He did something more than assimilate the technique
of Meissen in his hard paste, and the fact
that he was the first man to make real porcelain
in Denmark is only a part of the honour due to
him. He created what was far more difficult&mdash;a
national style.</p>

<p>Influences there undoubtedly were bearing on
the form and on the style of decoration employed
at Copenhagen. Luplau had little technique to
learn. He came as a maturely trained modeller
from F√ºrstenberg, which accounts for the fact
that busts and statuettes were produced at a
much earlier date in the history of the Copenhagen
than in a factory having slowly to train its
modellers. But undoubtedly a close examination
of the porcelain of the M√ºller period exhibits the
fact that there was a fine reticence applied to
the form and the decoration which stands out in
strong contrast to the extravagances and reckless
prodigality of ornament employed by factories
with older traditions. The new factory at Copenhagen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
was endowed with a sense of beauty from
the first. The rococo style prevalent then at
Meissen and dominating art is seldom found in
old Danish porcelain; now and again its presence
is noticeable and indicates that the work is of
the early experimental days. But Copenhagen
created a characteristic and natural style of its
own, not only in the choice of Danish or Norwegian
subjects, but in its intense love of nature
and of simple forms.</p>

<p>The whole series of fine <i>pot-pourri</i> vases with
natural flowers in relief is essentially different
from Meissen examples where the vase is overloaded
with fancifully modelled flowers and leaves.
The graceful form and subdued decoration of
Copenhagen stand out in effective contrast.</p>

<p>Moreover, the flowers themselves were evidently
copied direct from nature, and are executed with
such skill and refinement that they still stand as
ideals of technical and artistic perfection.</p>

<p>In regard to the modelling of figures, especially
those in costume, the reticence of Copenhagen
is noticeable in comparison with the <i>outr√©</i> cavaliers
and dames in crinolines of the Saxon and other
factories. The subdued colouring and the simple
charm of the Danish figures places them in a
gallery of their own. Nor must this be mistaken
for insipidity or weakness of design. Judged by
the highest canons of art, the quality of such
creations indicates complete control and mastery
of technique, and art in due subjection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>The outburst of strong national intensity, love
of nature, breadth of conception, and virility of
execution lasted at the most for twenty years.
The verse on a plate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Enhver sin S√¶k til M√∂llen b√¶rer<br />
Hvor tungt den ham end og besv√¶rer:</i></p>

<p>which may be turned into English:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Each man to the mill must bear his sack<br />
Although the load may break his back&mdash;</p>

<p>was the leading precept of the staff under M√ºller.
All worked together with single-heartedness of
purpose, and the result is the admiration of all
who love ceramic art, purposeful, and instinct
with grace and dignity.</p>

<p><b>The Diversity of Designs.</b>&mdash;The illustrations
accompanying this chapter will show the range
of subjects executed under the masterly <i>r√©gime</i>
of M√ºller. At first vases and services for royal
use were made, but as soon as the retail establishment
in 1780 enabled persons outside the royal
<i>entourage</i> to purchase the porcelain, the feet of
the factory were set on a rock. Similar forms
to those embellished with royal ciphers and monograms
and portraits were subsequently employed
for persons of lesser degree.</p>

<p>The portrait of M√ºller shows him to have been
a keen, virile, determined man, as we know, of
endless resources, and possessed of abnormal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
energy. In less than twenty years there had been
a constant and untiring enthusiasm in order to
bring the factory to such perfection that it would
be able to compete with the older and larger
factories of Meissen, Berlin, and S√®vres. Perhaps
this object was not achieved, inasmuch as the
little factory did not enter into the lists to win
European approval, but it succeeded in developing
a national style, and this in spite of the fact
that at the early stages it worked on foreign
suggestion and employed foreign artists. Owing
to the crowd of smaller factories at that date
assimilating the technique and copying the designs
of Meissen, it has come to be erroneously
believed, owing to the looseness of generalization
by writers on the subject and the absence of
detailed study of Copenhagen porcelain of that
period, that the Danish factory was another echo
of Meissen or Berlin. The contemporary opinion
of the two French counts, men of practised skill
in observation and keen critics in regard to comparing
the state of technique and conditions of
manufacture of one country with another, comes
as a complete refutation to the belief that Copenhagen
was then in the second rank.</p>

<p>In regard to M√ºller's technical achievements,
they stand to this day as a permanent record
of his mastery of his art. The new body which
he invented and called "virgin paste" is of a
clear dazzling white, and is covered with a glaze
transparent and smooth as polished crystal, tinted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
with the green of the sea; this glaze enhanced
the beauty of the porcelain. Considering the
impure materials then available, and the primitive
working methods (for instance, fuel used at
that time was wood, in poles 10 feet long of pine
and fir), the perfection and beauty of the results
demand profound admiration. Even with the
aid of modern technology and chemistry it has
not yet been found possible at the factory to
produce porcelain equal in every respect to the
old M√ºller period.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Illus_89" name="Illus_89"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PASTILLE BURNER AND COVER.</p>
<p class="center">On tripod stand with modelled dolphins as supports. Moulded
cherub heads, and gilded banded wreath in high relief. Perforated
cover surmounted by gilded pine-cone ornament.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The diverse character of the output was stupendous.
It was rich in design, varied and original
in invention, virile in modelling, and national in
spirit. The beautiful body invented by M√ºller
had its decoration with his perfected overglaze
colours, green and blue and purple. In regard
to gilding, the artistic ideal seems to have been
attained. It is not possible to convey as illustrations
in this volume the extraordinary variety
and beauty exhibited in this field. In the cups
and saucers herein illustrated, the fine quality
of the designs is lost in translation, but these
borders of deep blue enriched with gilded designs
of the most exquisite character are something
to marvel at in connection with the work of the
M√ºller period.</p>

<p>The creations of the factory cover a wide range.
The versatility of the modellers and the artists
is pronouncedly marked. It bespeaks a great
and prolific period when ideas were not lacking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
Evidently there was no great searching after
novelty, the gold was not beaten thin, apparently
there was a profusion of intellectual force behind
the factory. The difference is noticeable as soon
as the great period is passed, when one falls on
barren ways and thinly eked out inventions, the
long years of the dreary twilight.</p>

<p>The love of landscape especially appealed to
Copenhagen. The colours of the ceramic artist
have limitations peculiarly their own. Atmosphere
is rare in overglaze painting. There is a tendency
to prettiness and an absence of breadth. But
with pigments so refractory there are instances
of work surprisingly powerful. Single colour
scenes fare best, and there is one example in
purple, poor enough medium, which has qualities
almost suggesting the strength of a Dutch etching,
as shown on a cup and saucer in the <i>Dansk Folke
Museum</i>. The picturesque in colour finds its
exposition in two octagonal dishes with sporting
subjects. The one shows a man with a hound
(illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_93">93</a>), and the other a man with a
red coat engaged in the pastime of hawking.</p>

<p>Vases with portraits secured their patrons.
There is one at the <i>Kunstindustri Museum</i> at
Bergen; with the portrait of G. W. Rabener,
born at Leipsic in 1714 and died in 1771, the
friend of Klopstock, and the good-humoured
satirist of German <i>bourgeois</i> society.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">OCTAGONAL DISH.</p>
<p class="center">With figure subject, Huntsman with hound, finely painted in colours.

</div></div>

<p>Apart from colour and decoration, there is the
fine modelling. The symmetry of the more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
vases, instinct with decorative qualities
of the highest order, having ornament in relief,
moulded garlands, gay Cupids, or mask handles
of some wood-god, is always paramount. Rarely
is there a false note.</p>

<p>To form and the mastery of the difficulties
and the due observance of the technique of the
potter, it is necessary to devote another chapter
in which the illustrations convey sufficient evidence
to show that projecting limbs and fantastic
shapes more suitable to the metal-worker were
eschewed at Copenhagen. The essentials of
ceramics were never lost sight of by the band
of modellers working under M√ºller.</p>

<p><b>National Sentiment.</b>&mdash;There is a vein of sentiment,
very pleasing and very piquant, running
through much of the work of this period. It is
the under-note of the potter, who, as other potters
of other nations have before him, desired to
convey a written message as well as the message
in line, in colour, and in beauty of form that he
set before his generation. Centuries before M√ºller,
the Chinese potter revelled in his inscriptions.
Potters the world over apparently are poets.
On an old Chinese porcelain vase painted in blue,
with a garden scene by moonlight, the following
inscription in Chinese is found:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Heaven and earth are the associates of
creation, as light and darkness are the passing
guests of a hundred generations. Fleeting life is
like a dream; how long do we enjoy it? It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
this knowledge that made men in the old days
trim the midnight lamp. And now Yang Chun
invites us with smoke to illuminate the world
with literature, to associate the fragrant gardens
of the peach and the plum, and to talk of happiness.
All graciously join me, and as they chant
and sing, I alone am ashamed; they become
vivacious, I in solitude rejoice. With loud talk
they grow merry; a scholar's feast is spread, and
sitting amid the flowers we pass the goblet quickly
and drink till we are drunken. When the moon
is not in its splendour, how can one expatiate on
its ecstasy? But if my verses are not perfect I
am fined the customary gold and the embarrassing
wine."</p>

<p>Here is the Chinese potter&mdash;almost Viking-like in his song of the
wine-cup in place of the wassail-bowl. Or shall it be the Persian
astronomer-poet Omar Khayy√°m with his&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">The Grape that can with Logic absolute<br />
The Two-and-seventy jarring Sects confute:<br />
<span class="pad1">The subtle Alchemist that in a Trice</span><br />
Life's leaden Metal into Gold transmute.</p>

<p>The Staffordshire potters to a man loved a rhymed couplet on a jug
or mug or punch-bowl, and their crude efforts amuse the latter-day
collector. Their subjects were varied in character&mdash;loyalty, naval
victories, courtship, and conviviality, with a smack of religion, as,
for instance:&mdash;</p>


<p class="poem">Drink to live and live to die<br />
That you may live eternally.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>

<p>There are many pretty sentiments found on
M√ºller's ware. We have already quoted one
(p. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>), and there are many mottoes inscribed in
Danish on the porcelain of his period. There
is the long inscription on the cup with his portrait
(see p. <a href="#Illus_69">69</a>), and there are others which we have
translated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Art bends nature to herself that clay<br />
By magic is transformed to gold alway;</p>

<p>and an inscription on another example, translated
runs:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Long live the King, and glorious be his reign;<br />
Long live ourselves to drink this toast again.</p>

<p>In the collection at Rosenborg Castle there is a
cup and saucer upon which the letter F is painted
in forget-me-nots. It is dated November 22, 1797,
with this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Uforglemmelige ungdomsaar for mig!</i><br />
(Years of youth, unforgettable for me!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>We wonder for whom this initial F stands. The permanently abiding
sentiment enshrined behind the glass case is to-day as fresh as the
forget-me-nots. What romance lies hidden in these four Danish words
burnt into the clay? But the records are silent, and F the giver or
the receiver is turned into dust, while the potter's clay stands to
symbolize an old-world story of the days when youthful ambitions and
dreams lit up the memory.</p>

<p class="chap_overview">The inauguration of new impulses, 1780&mdash;Luplau, the
modelling-master&mdash;The figure subjects of Kalleberg&mdash;Classification of
figure subjects&mdash;Old Copenhagen figures, their national character&mdash;The
last days of M√ºller.</p>


<p>Apart from the royal busts and statuettes, the
sumptuous vases with portraits of royalties, and
the magnificent services made for royal use or
for some important personage, culminating in the
great and extensive <i>Flora Danica</i> service, there
were other examples, notably figure subjects and
groups, often of a minor character, and vases and
services of less splendour in their decoration but
not of inferior character.</p>

<p>The date of these may be determined as subsequent to the year 1780,
when a retail establishment was opened in Copenhagen in the heyday of
M√ºller's triumph, for the sale of the factory productions. An outburst
of popular feeling hailed this adventure with delight. The chronicles
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span> the time are full of the subject. Hitherto great and important
pieces were made under the Court patronage of Queen Juliane Marie and
of Prince Frederik, her son, and important subjects were executed,
giving to this period a character and dignity not surpassed by many
of the older factories. But the royal factory now became the national
factory. Henceforth merchants, burghers, the professional classes, and
the Danish public in general were enabled to see a permanent exhibition
of the ware of the Royal Porcelain Factory, and to purchase or give
orders for a national ware which, naturally, was supplanting the use
of all others in the country. In the year 1790 the importation of any
foreign porcelain save Chinese was prohibited by law.</p>

<p>From 1780 to 1790 one may expect to find the
factory in full enjoyment of success, particularly
in regard to its manufacture and sale of utilitarian
blue fluted services, underglaze painted, and of
small figures and vases, overglaze painted, of a
less magnificent character, designed for use and
ornament in the home rather than representative
of types more fitted for presents to foreign princes
and plenipotentiaries. In 1790 M√ºller was fifty-eight
years of age. In 1801 he had retired from
the factory.</p>

<p>This chapter, while including important figures
and groups, deals with types of a class which may
be termed as in the second flight of M√ºller's
artistic triumphs, and be it said much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
work is contemporary with more ambitious
creations equal in character to some of the finest.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>At the National Museum, Stockholm.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>As many of these minor pieces are dated and
others have the signature of the artist or modeller,
it is possible to arrive, with some degree of
accuracy, at the period of their manufacture.
Contemporary with all these overglaze painted
examples of the factory one must not lose sight
of the fact that the mussel-blue underglaze painted
ware was continuously being made. New forms
were being added, and its decoration with the
"Danish pattern" adhered closely to the original
floral <i>motif</i> now perennial to the ware.</p>

<p><b>Luplau, the Modelling Master.</b>&mdash;In regarding the
figure subjects, it must be borne in mind that
the foreign assistance which M√ºller called in at
the inception of the factory had not a little influence
on the early and sure production of figures
which could not have been attempted without
experienced supervision. Under Anton Carl
Luplau, the modelling-master who came to
Copenhagen from the F√ºrstenberg factory, where
he had spent eighteen years, the early stages of
the Copenhagen modelling show a completer
mastery of the technique than is usually exhibited
by so young a factory.</p>

<p>But design and modelling, excellent though
they undoubtedly were in the hands of Luplau,
were only factors in the problem towards perfected
results. The body, the glaze, and the colours
were M√ºller's. Nor is it to be supposed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
Luplau contributed more than the idea, practical
without doubt, but it is improbable that he
carried his supervision beyond the plastic stages.
All credit is due to him for instilling the principles
of fine lines and graceful forms into the minds of
the young potters. But it was M√ºller by day
and by night, with long vigils, often all night, at
the ovens with his workmen whom he was training
to control the caprice of the furnace, who seized
the situation and gladly profited by experience
in his uphill struggle to establish his factory in
the face of all difficulties. M√ºller had the genius
of "moulding men in plastic circumstance." Nor
was Luplau the swan he is sometimes thought
to have been. There is a suggestion in one of
M√ºller's letters to the board of management of
the factory which illuminates the inner history.
Speaking of Luplau, and probably the old story&mdash;the
cost of production&mdash;he says: "On the contrary,
he demands extra payment for any work
which he does himself, and as the factory cannot
afford this, most of the figures and moulds are
made by Kalleberg, and in this work Luplau
appears to take a very small share."</p>

<p><b>The Figure Subjects of Kalleberg.</b>&mdash;The fertility
of the early Copenhagen period when masterpieces,
full of charm and perfect in style, rapidly
appeared one after another in a short but crowded
period, has puzzled students of the old period.
To accept Luplau as the creator of them all, is
to believe him classic and precise, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
moment capable of transforming his style into
elegant, restrained creations of gaiety and fanciful
forms in due subjection. To omit the subtle
and critical examination of style is to fall into
the pit which contains those curious mortals who
believe the exact, terse, and laboured prose of
Bacon to be by the author of <i>A Midsummer
Night's Dream</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>. To such, it is possible
to credit Julius C√¶sar with having written the
ode of Horatius Flaccus to <i>Lyde</i>.</p>

<p>There is some mystery as to the designer of
the dancing figures, the flute-player, the lady at
the tea-table, the Copenhagen group, the Norwegian
dalemen in Fredensborg, the mountain-men,
and certain dainty Cupids. They differ entirely
from Laplau's productions in every respect, and
stand far above them in artistic merit. The
late Professor Krohn, whose patient researches,
on this and other vexed questions concerning old
Copenhagen porcelain, were unfortunately broken
off by his untimely death, was of the opinion
that these figure subjects were the work of the
<i>repouss√©</i> worker Kalleberg. Authentic confirmation
is lacking, other than the letter above quoted.
Until further evidence is forthcoming and further
investigations are made into the M√ºller period,
we must accept the authentic pronouncement by
M√ºller as the last word on the subject.</p>

<p>In regard to the employment of foreigners, it
is certain that the experiment was not a success.
Five workmen were inveigled from Meissen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
1776. Out of the five, probably induced by
monetary considerations to quit the Meissen
factory, two did not make an appearance in
Copenhagen. Of the three who came, it seems
that only one showed any great talent. It would
appear, too, that they exhibited an arrogance
that stirred up strife in the factory. They
received higher wages than the Danish workmen
and began to assume correspondingly superior
manners, with the belief that the factory could
not proceed without them. But M√ºller speedily
put an end to this state of affairs by closing
the factory gates against them, and when they
attempted to break in, he had them turned out
by force. With these experiences in mind, it
is not surprising that when, at a later date,
some English workmen from the Wedgwood
factory desired employment, they received scanty
consideration.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Figure Subjects.</b>&mdash;The figure

<li class="lev1">Portrait Busts and Statuettes and Classic
figures, in biscuit&mdash;</li>

<li class="lev2">such as those of Queen Juliane Marie and
the Hereditary Prince Frederik, and the
statuette of <i>A Hero</i> at the National Museum,
Stockholm (illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_115">115</a>)</li>

<li class="lev1">Ornamental subjects, in white&mdash;</li>

<li class="lev2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>such as the centre-piece with the supporting
Cupids at the <i>Dansk Folke Museum</i>,
Copenhagen, and the remarkably fine vases,
4 feet high, at Frederiksborg, having
powerfully modelled groups of female
classic figures.</li>

<li class="lev1">Classic figures and subjects, decorated in
colours, overglaze&mdash;</li>

<li class="lev2">such as the group <i>Flora and Minerva</i> by
Jacob Schmidt and <i>Sea Horses</i> at the

<li class="lev1">Romantic subjects in costume, decorated in
colours, overglaze&mdash;</li>

<li class="lev2">such as <i>Lovers with Cupid and Garlands</i>
(illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_123">123</a>), and small figures
of women and children in fanciful costume.</li>

<li class="lev2">There is at Frederiksborg Castle a group&mdash;<i>Chinese

offering her a basket of fruit. This

<li class="lev1">Figure subjects in correct contemporary costume&mdash;practically a ceramic
gallery faithfully reflecting the social character of the period&mdash;</li>

<li class="lev2">such as the <i>Flute Player</i>, the <i>Lady and

especially fine series of peasant types in old
costume, engaged at their various vocations&mdash;e.g.
two groups of <i>Norwegian Miners</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
with black costume and green caps, with
C7 in gold (at Frederiksborg Castle). The
<i>Woman with Hens</i>, in Norwegian costume,
a <i>Market Woman with Fowls</i>, a <i>Lobster-seller</i>,

</ul>

<p><b>Old Copenhagen Figures&mdash;their National Character.</b>&mdash;In
regard to the series of figures in
contemporary costume, there is an air about
them which stamps them at once as being the
work of the old Copenhagen factory. They are
practically portrait studies, with that added touch
of poetic charm which fits them for their place
among the gods of the china cabinet.</p>

<p>They challenge comparison with the work of
other European factories. K√§ndler, the modeller
at Meissen, in what is styled the <i>Krinolinengruppen</i>
period in mid eighteenth-century days, produced
figures of lovers and ladies in rich costumes.
They belong to that impossible world of the
china-shelf, of shepherds and shepherdesses and
bending cavaliers and gay ladies, conjured up in
the fertile brain of the potter. They invaded
France and they conquered England in the glorious
days of Derby and Chelsea. But with a few
notable exceptions they did not penetrate to
Copenhagen.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>At the Dansk Folke Museum, Copenhagen.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The groups of <i>Lovers with Cupids</i> and chains of
roses are two examples of this romantic movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
which came into the world of ceramics, a reflex
of the decorative art of fashionable Court painters,
who invented a topsy-turvy world of make-believe.</p>

<p>The quiet strength and the subdued restraint
of the old Copenhagen figures stand out in contrast
to this outburst of fanciful exuberance. The
note of fidelity is as apparent in the figures in
costume of the M√ºller period as it is noticeable
in regard to floral decorations and modelled
foliage taken direct from nature. Nor does this
betray a want of imagination or a lack of ideality
in choice of figure subjects. If it be classic, there
is poetry in the statuette of <i>A Hero</i>, or a loose
rein is given by the modeller to his <i>Sea Horses</i>,
a poet's vision of the sea rollers leaping shore-wards
from the Baltic. The fashion for the
romantic did eventually tinge the Copenhagen
<i>atelier</i>. Some of the little figures are graceful,
retiring, modest examples of the movement. It
is true they are decked in impossible costumes,
but the mode has in the transplantation acquired
simplicity and reticence. Some of them suggest,
in porcelain, the quaint charm of Kate
Greenaway's world of picturesque children.</p>

<p>Of the gallery of contemporary life the Copenhagen
figures, in the main, are faithful likenesses.
The dancing cavalier and lady (see <a href="#FRONTISPIECE"><i>Frontispiece</i></a>)
represent persons who actually did dance as they
are modelled. There is nothing added except
that touch of the modeller's genius in catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
the rhythmical pose of the poetry of motion which
crystallizes them as a work of art. The <i>Flute
Player</i> is equally caught in the act, natural and
unobtrusive. There is nothing affected in his
attitude or in his costume (illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_127">127</a>).
It is such traits as these which endear the old
Copenhagen figures to connoisseurs. The glaze
is rich and liquid and the colours are subdued
in tone and appeal to lovers of subtlety in art.
Whatever extraneous influences in art press
upon the work of the Danish potters, there is a
process of refining which they seemingly undergo,
and in so doing</p>


<p class="poem"><span class="pad5">Suffer a sea change</span><br />
Into something rich and strange.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, these old-world figures
are much treasured by Danish collectors, who
realize that they represent a national phase of
art and form a record of quaint and forgotten
costume. The sellers in the market-place, the
women with fowls, the fisherman with the striped
jersey and shiny hat familiar in old prints of our
own sailormen, and the Admiral with his speaking
trumpet&mdash;it might be the great Fischer himself,
of the days when fleets were sweeping the North
Sea and the Baltic&mdash;come with peculiar associations
from bygone days.</p>

<p><b>The Last Days of M√ºller.</b>&mdash;The illustrations
herein given cover this diverse field and serve
to indicate the versatility of the modellers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
worked during the M√ºller period. The peasant
types and some of the smaller figures belong to
the latter days of the M√ºller <i>r√©gime</i>. Although
M√ºller retired from the factory in 1801, he kept
in touch with what was in progress. His hand
may not have been on the helm, but he had spirit
enough left in his retirement to burst forth with
pungent criticisms upon the later methods pursued,
and there is no doubt the old veteran was
frequently consulted by those upon whom his
mantle had fallen. The fiery spirit of M√ºller,
proof against all adversity, with the eye of the
eagle saw across a longer space than men of ordinary
vision. "Everything which has been done after
I left the factory," growls out the fiery old man,
"has been to its detriment." And who shall
say that his words were not true?</p>

<p>M√ºller had heard the guns booming in the
Sound in 1801, he had seen the havoc of bombardment
by an alien fleet in 1807. His heart's desire,
his beloved factory, had been wrecked. A great
man's treasure-house of dreams had been devastated.
The story of the ruin which overtook
the factory comes with stunning poignancy with
the knowledge that owing to the misery which
followed the war the factory actually closed
down in 1810, for a time, owing to the want of
fuel. Years after the death of M√ºller and the
glories of his day had departed, a number of his
oldest models and moulds were found in a heap
of shards stowed away in a loft in the old factory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
At the removal to the new factory at Frederiksberg
it was hardly thought worth while to carry
them away.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this was done, and in spite of
their wrecked condition, loving hands have pieced
them together. It is now happily possible to
reproduce faithfully some two hundred of the
beautiful models of the great days.</p>

<p>Frantz Heinrich M√ºller, the greatest potter of
Denmark, is not dead, although his ashes have
lain in a nameless grave for nearly a century.
His memory still lies green in the hearts of those
who love great things finely conceived, great
triumphs nobly won, and great dreams perfectly
consummated.</p>

<p class="chap_head2"><i>MADE FOR CATHERINE II, EMPRESS OF RUSSIA</i></p>

<p class="chap_overview">The Crown Prince Frederik (afterwards Frederik VI)
orders the Flora Danica service to be made&mdash;A
period of twelve years occupied in making it&mdash;The
taste of the Empress Catherine II of Russia&mdash;Theodor

<p>A separate chapter is devoted to the great
service executed by the Royal Copenhagen Factory
during the years 1790 to 1802. It takes a place
with other great services, the masterpieces of old
and distinguished factories, such as the magnificent
table service of <i>p√¢te tendre</i> S√®vres porcelain
finished in 1778 for the Empress Catherine II
of Russia, consisting of about 750 pieces and
costing some ¬£13,200. The Empress, it is interesting
to read, considered this price exorbitant,
and a lengthy diplomatic correspondence ensued.
This service was part of the imperial collection
at St. Petersburg. The celebrated Wedgwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
dinner service of earthenware made for Catherine II
and delivered in 1774, consists of painted English
scenery, depicting famous views and noblemen's
seats. This comprised over 950 pieces, and a
portion of it was exhibited in London in 1909
by Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood and Sons, of Etruria,
by permission of late His Imperial Majesty the
Emperor of Russia.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Flora Danica</i> service had as a patron the
Crown Prince Frederik, the son of Christian VII
and Queen Caroline Matilda. In 1784 another
palace revolution had happened. The power of
Queen Juliane Marie and her son, the king's
brother, was broken. Prince Frederik (afterwards
Frederik VI on the death of his father
Christian VII, at the age of fifty-nine, in 1808)
assumed the presidency of the State Council,
after an unseemly struggle for the person of the
imbecile king had taken place between him and
his uncle Frederik, Prince Hereditary, resulting in
the complete rout of the latter. The same day,
April 14, 1784, the Crown Prince Frederik was
proclaimed Regent. From that moment the rule
of the Queen Dowager and her son Frederik was
ended. She and her son retained their apartments
at Christiansborg Palace, and Fredensborg
was set apart for the use of Queen Juliane
Marie. She lived in retirement until her death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
in 1796. Her son Frederik refrained from
meddling in State affairs, and confined his attention
to the welfare of art and science.</p>

<p>Frederik VI, endeared to his people more than
any other Danish king, in spite of his military
brusqueness, was as simple and frugal as our
own Farmer-King, George III, whose grandson
he was. Frederik's blue cotton umbrella is still
exhibited as a relic in his apartments in Rosenborg
Castle, and at his death, in 1830, all classes mourned
the loss of a friend. Peasants bore the coffin
of the old monarch tenderly to his last resting-place
at Roskilde.</p>

<p>He was twenty years of age when Count Marshal
B√ºlow, with a fatherly regard for the Crown
Prince, and desirous of giving that touch of
refinement denied the youth by the naturalistic
theories of Struensee and the sterner methods
of the Queen Dowager, took him from his military
duties to pay early morning visits to the Royal
factory. These glimpses into a world of artistry
cannot have been other than stimulating to the
young prince. Struensee's Rousseau-like training
had made him a child of nature, and Juliane
Marie had twisted him into the cast-iron grooves
of a stiff and formal Court etiquette. In regard
to art, he came at a time when the love of nature
was becoming paramount. The age was rapidly
shaking off the artificial. Sated with rococo
ornament and with insipid and frivolous unrealities,
the pendulum swung to the natural and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
essentially simple. Straight or shapely curved
lines became the fashion. The period of <i>Louis
Seize</i> had succeeded the rococo taste of <i>Louis
Quinze</i> in Continental art.</p>

<p><b>The Taste of the Empress Catherine of Russia.</b>&mdash;From
1784, when he made his <i>coup d'√©tat</i>,
Frederik advisedly gave important orders to the
royal factory. In 1790 the <i>Flora Danica</i> service
was ordered by the Crown Prince. It was not
at first known for whom it was intended. The
old factory books record it as "<i>Perle model broge
malet med Flora Danica</i>" (Pearl body, colour
painted with <i>Flora Danica</i>). As the service
progressed it transpired that it was to be presented
to Catherine II, Empress of Russia. The modern
spirit was in the air, the new style was realistic
and tinged with a scientific <i>motif</i>; moreover, it
was to be a gift to a bluestocking. The Empress
Catherine essayed to make her Court the centre
of letters and art. At great cost she purchased
the library of Diderot, and invited him to come
to St. Petersburg to be the custodian of his own
collection. She corresponded with Voltaire and
she talked philosophy with Grimm, who, in his
celebrated <i>Correspondance Litt√©raire</i>, kept her informed
of the latest plays and books appearing
in Paris. She established a French theatre in
St. Petersburg, and fined absentee courtiers fifty
roubles and sent her guards to bring in those who
had failed to attend. French visionaries looked
to Russia as a land of promise. Voltaire never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
tired of proclaiming that the Mohammedans should
be driven out of Europe. And the Empress
Catherine was to be the chosen instrument. The
philosopher of Ferney, with his pen dipped in
honey, writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Si vous √©tiez souveraine de Constantinople
votre majest√© √©tablirait bien vite une belle acad√©mie
grecque; on vous ferait une Cat√©riniade; les Zeuxis
et les Phidias couvriraient la terre de vos images;
la chute de l'empire ottoman serait c√©l√©br√©e en grec;
Ath√®nes serait une de vos capitales; la langue
grecque deviendrait la langue universelle; tous les
negocians de la mer Eg√©e demanderaient des passeports
de votre majest√©.</i>"</p>

<p>The great Danish service was therefore to be a fitting present for
so powerful a queen. For some twelve years the work was continued
uninterruptedly. At first it was designed for eighty persons, and in
1794 no less than 1,835 pieces were ready. The death of the Empress
Catherine II in 1796 precluded the service joining those of S√®vres and
Wedgwood in the imperial palace at St. Petersburg. But its manufacture
was still continued. In 1797 it had enlarged its dimensions, and was
fit for a hundred persons. In 1802 it was stopped. If counted in
English fashion, with lid, bowl, and stand as three pieces, the number
had grown to three thousand pieces, or some two thousand, counting
such vessels as one piece. The dessert service alone amounted to six
hundred and twenty-three pieces, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span> of basket vases, flower
and fruit stands, and, as is usual in dessert services, exceptionally
fine examples, elegant, finely modelled, and exquisitely painted.</p>

<p>The date of the completion of the <i>Flora Danica</i>
service practically coincides with the date of the
retirement of M√ºller from the directorship of
the factory, and therefore with this service ends
the great and prolific M√ºller period.</p>

<p>In the examination of the <i>Flora Danica</i> service
considerable attention has been paid to the artistic
and decorative results, but insufficient study has
been given to the causes which led to the inception
of so scientific an idea in regard to the record of
the national flora on a service of such importance.</p>

<p><b>Theodor Holmskjold, the Botanist.</b>&mdash;The patron,
as we have seen, was the Crown Prince Frederik.
The artist entrusted with the painting of the
work was A. C. Ba√øer, but the guiding spirit of
the enterprise undoubtedly was Theodor Holmskjold,
who was a botanist of some distinction, had
studied under the world-renowned Von Linn√© at
Upsala, and was his favourite pupil. Holmskjold,
a director of the factory throughout the great
Juliane Marie period, and almost to the end of
M√ºller's long control, brought the scientific spirit
of exactitude into the field of decorative art.
Originally by name Holm, he took, after his
ennoblement in 1781, the title of Holmskjold.
He was professor of medicine and natural history
at S√∂roe, the Danish Eton, where he planned a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
botanical garden, and later he took part in the
management of the Botanical Gardens at Copenhagen.
His work on <i>Danish Fungi</i> is distinguished
by the artistic excellence of the illustrations,
which were made by Ba√øer. In 1767 he became
postmaster-general of Copenhagen. In 1772, the
year of the masked ball at Christiansborg, we
find him cabinet secretary to Queen Juliane Marie.
Undoubtedly at that time the man of science
put aside his dried specimens to join in the whirl
of politics and Court intrigue which ended in the
seizure of Struensee and Queen Matilda&mdash;the
gallows-tree for the dictator and imprisonment
for Denmark's young queen. The classification
of <i>fungi</i> was seemingly little enough preparation
for the pinking of Court butterflies, when plots
of assassination were rife, and when the actors'
heads were not secure on their shoulders. But
Holmskjold, together with another student, Suhm,
the historian, who came from his library and
helped to make history, ably acquitted himself.
He was a trusted confidant of Queen Juliane
Marie. It was he who induced the queen to
take up M√ºller's company, and himself (then
Holm) became one of the directors.</p>

<p>Long after Queen Juliane Marie's power had
waned, we find him true to his allegiance to her,
as in 1792 he became chamberlain to her Court.
His connection with M√ºller was intimate. A
widower in 1780, M√ºller married Holm's somewhat
elderly sister. In brother-in-law Holm M√ºller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
found a good patron. His position at the Court,
his relationship with M√ºller, his intense desire to
win renown for an enterprise to which he had
himself obtained the royal appellation, made
him at once a powerful and interested ally. He
died in 1793, before the final completion of the
great service to which his influence had contributed
so much, but not before he had seen the establishment
of the Royal Copenhagen porcelain under
the <i>r√©gime</i> of Queen Juliane Marie, his mistress,
attain great eminence and distinction.</p>

<p>It is impossible to ignore Holmskjold's special
and particular influence on the character of the
decorations of the great Copenhagen Catherine II
service. The personality of the botanist-director
is here evident. But apart from this individual
influence, in an examination of the causes likely
to have contributed to the style of decoration
employed, passing mention must be made of the
great national enterprise planned by Oeder in
1761: the original idea being that all European
Governments should contribute to a series of
volumes illustrating the complete flora of Europe.
By this scientific co-operation duplication was
thus to be avoided, and each plant would be
described once only.</p>

<p>Denmark alone took sufficient interest in the botanical work to
complete it. Austria touched the fringe of her flora with five hundred
illustrations, and Russia contributed a hundred. So the <i>Flora Danica</i>,
under the guidance of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span> generations of botanists, ploughed its
solitary furrow alone. The first volume, containing the first three
parts, was issued by Oeder in 1766. The plants were painted <i>in situ</i>
by zealous artist-botanists who travelled to the remote districts of
Denmark. This magnificent undertaking was in its earliest stages when
the great porcelain service was in contemplation.</p>

<p>It is interesting here to note the further history
of the great botanical work. Five parts were
issued by O. F. M√ºller from 1775 to 1787. Vahl,
the great botanist, who died in 1804, followed
on by another five parts, and the next seventeen
parts, extending over a period of thirty-five years,
were under the editorship of J. W. Horniman,
who published a history of the progress of the
work from its inception down to 1836. By royal
decree in 1847 it was decided to accept illustrations
of Swedish and Norwegian plants not found
in Denmark, thus increasing the scope and value
of the work. It was to be completed in fifty-one
parts, and not until the year 1883 was this great
botanical work of the <i>Flora Danica</i> pronounced
finished!</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that, apart from Holmskjold's
special and particular predilections, there were
general and national impulses directed towards
this work of exceptional character and of European
importance. It may readily be imagined
that, prior to the advent of the <i>Flora Danica</i>
service, the artists at the royal factory who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
painted flowers had, under the vigilant eye of
the specialist director, to paint them from nature.
A convolvulus did not become so decoratively
treated as to evade identification. The Greek
honeysuckle pattern of conventional use would
not have passed at Copenhagen. Conventionality
was as much eschewed in decoration as was the
rococo in modelling. It is thus evident that
nature and nature study, so remarkable and
beautiful a feature in Copenhagen porcelain, owes
not a little to the trained scientific vision of
Theodor Holmskjold, the botanist.</p>

<p>Other factors enter into the question of the
consideration of this <i>Flora Danica</i> service. It
is obvious that the national feeling in artistic
and scientific circles was centred on nature and
nature study. Jean-Jacques had shown mankind
that Dame Nature was capable of being
wooed with intense passion. It was not until
the late eighteenth century that the beauties of
landscape began to be assiduously sought after.
Travellers crossed the Alps from one country to
another and regarded the frowning mountain,
the sombre pass, or the rushing torrent much
in the same manner as the unpoetic mariner
feared the hurricane. Nature in her majestic
loneliness was appalling. The sunny slopes of the
Apennines concealed volcanic terrors. The smile
of the blue Lake of Como was as treacherous as
the dancing waves of the fickle sea itself. Lakes
and mountains and mountain gorges were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
avoided; no mortal had conceived the idea of
discovering their beauty. They were as fearsome
as the Pillars of Hercules to the Latin mariners.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>At Rosenborg Castle, Copenhagen.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>In England, Thomas Gray, the poet, made a
journey into Westmoreland and Cumberland in
1765 to see the Lake Country. His letters are
the first note in English literature of man's kinship
with nature. It took a century for the modern
thought to germinate&mdash;"great men are part of
the infinite, brothers of the mountain and the sea."
As early as 1739, Gray's letters to his mother are
filled with passages extolling the grandeur of the
crags and precipices of the Alps, at a time when
Rousseau had not developed his later method,
and Vernet had only commenced to paint the
turbulent sea with ecstasy.</p>

<p>In Denmark, in 1790, when the first model of the <i>Flora Danica</i> service
was turned on the potter's wheel, this inquiring and reflective spirit
was in the air, and the general tendency manifestly found a reflex in
the great national service being manufactured at the Royal Porcelain
Factory. The Russian Government had already entered into co-operation
in a small degree in regard to bringing the records of the Russian
flora into line with that of Denmark, and Catherine II, as is known,
was the patron of the German naturalist Dr. P. S. Pallas, who, in
1784, commenced a <i>Flora Russica</i>, which was to eclipse anything yet
attempted. This was to be published at the expense of Catherine. At her
wish Pallas had in 1768<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span> undertaken a scientific expedition to Siberia,
which occupied six years.</p>

<p>In this connection, therefore, and knowing the
Empress Catherine to be a votary of science and
of art, the services made in England, France,
and Denmark for imperial use were not undertaken
without due consideration of this fact.
The S√®vres service was embellished with the art
of the schools of Boucher, Lancret, and Watteau;
the Wedgwood service was frankly topographical,
having painted copies, in mulberry purple, of
old engravings, and Copenhagen was designedly
botanical, based on the coloured illustrations of
the <i>Flora Danica</i> volumes.</p>

<p><b>The Service.</b>&mdash;A notable visitor to the factory
at the time of the inception of the <i>Flora Danica</i>
service was the Chevalier Louis de Boisgelin,
Knight of Malta, who published his <i>Travels through
Denmark and Sweden</i> in English in two volumes,
at London, in 1810. The Comte Alfonse de Fortia,
his fellow-traveller, had previously published <i>Les
Voyages de deux Fran√ßois dans le Nord de l'Europe</i>.
As a trustworthy account of a contemporary eye-witness
the opinion of de Boisgelin is quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The most beautiful porcelain likely to be
sent for a long time from this manufacture will
be a complete service upon which is to be represented,
in natural colours, all the plants of the
<i>Flora Danica</i>, with one upon each piece, large
or small, according to the dimensions of the piece.
The name of the plant will be marked under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
plate, and the whole is to be classed according
to the Linn√¶an system. The drawings are traced
with such wonderful accuracy, that the most
famous painters belonging to the manufactory
would not undertake so difficult and slavish a
piece of work."</p>

<p>This last statement as to the mechanical accuracy
required in the painting of the flora stamps it
as something outside the realm of the ordinary
flower painter, and indicates at once the extreme
scientific definition of drawing required.</p>

<p>The Royal Copenhagen Factory had come to be recognized by other
Continental factories as excelling in the modelling of flowers, and
as exhibiting truthful and natural beauty in their employment for
decorative effect. The originality of the shapes of this service in
comparison with those of contemporary factories shows them to possess
a fine reticence which does not detract from the grand and imposing
character of the imperial service. The border is a new and bold
treatment with serrated leaf design, richly gilded and having three
rows of gilt pearls. In point of decoration the new style is realistic,
but far too scientific in treatment.</p>

<p>As a service it is magnificent. It amply fulfils the great and
inspired conceptions of its originators. Luplau was still a modeller,
skilful and practised in his own field of dignified, restrained,
and well-balanced forms compelling admiration, and the bouquets and
floral ornaments were modelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span> S√∂ren Preus. In painted decoration
the scientific atmosphere is only too evident. Ba√øer's pencil too
faithfully followed the botanical volumes of the <i>Flora Danica</i>. Each
piece is different; the whole gamut of the flora was covered, but each
subject was obviously not equally suitable for decorative effect. True
decorative art, however realistic, is alien from scientific exactitude.</p>

<p>The plants with their roots, leaves, and cross-sections
of the stems evade decorative treatment.
The scientific spirit is further exhibited in the
written Latin names and references to the text
of <i>Flora Danica</i> appearing at the back of each
piece. But it must be reiterated that it was
intended as a present to a votary of Von Linn√©,
and the scientific study of nature had challenged
the capture of nature by art.</p>

<p>The magnificence of the great service is the
magnificence of a great series of ceramic volumes,
reflecting in another medium the triumphs of
the illustrated volumes of the <i>Flora Danica</i>.</p>

<p>It is the first instance of the Copenhagen factory
searching for designs in a domain foreign to the
true natural sources of inspiration proper to
the artist designer on porcelain. Another and
later instance is the series of imitative porcelain
statuettes after Thorvaldsen's creations in marble.</p>

<p class="chap_overview">The "Danish Pattern"&mdash;The Bornholm Clay period&mdash;Peculiarities in
marking&mdash;Table of Marks (old blue-and-white underglaze painted
porcelain).</p>


<p>The blue-and-white underglaze painted porcelain
of Copenhagen has become recognized as characteristic
of the royal factory and of Denmark.
The original design is of Chinese origin, in common
with other forms of decoration, centuries
old, followed by all European potters in early
days when the art of making true porcelain was
discovered in the West. But, like many another
transplantation in art, it found congenial atmosphere,
and has become national to the country
of its adoption. The light, graceful plant <i>motif</i>
shown in the blue-and-white painted fluted porcelain
is as welcome a sight to Danes the world over
as the slender twin spires of Roskilde Cathedral,
where the kings of Denmark sleep in eternal
peace.</p>

<p>The "Danish pattern" bears in a measure a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
certain relationship to works in literature where
the translation is greater than the original.</p>

<p>This is especially true when the work of a
decadent period is translated into the richer
tongue of a more golden age. The English Bible
translated in the time of James I is richer in its
fine wealth of prose than the "original sacred
tongues."</p>

<p>Some arts have been lost. It is said that the
art of translation has never been discovered.
All have laboured after it in vain; it is as hard
to seek as hidden treasure, and one never finds
it. But the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Factory
found the "hidden treasure" in the design which
has grown into a thousand shapes inspired by
the traditions of M√ºller, who "laid the East in
fee," and whose successors true to his memory
are not those</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pad5">Who would keep an ancient form</span><br />
Through which the spirit breathes no more.</p>

<p>From the manor farms of Vendsyssel to the
confines of Danish-built Altona, from the white
cliffs of M√∂en to the ancient roofed city of Ribe,
the blue-and-white underglaze painted porcelain
plates and dishes have been family heirlooms
since the days of Christian VII.</p>

<p>The <i>Flora Danica</i> service represents the greatest
complete creation in the overglaze painted work
of the royal factory, and this blue-and-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
stands as the greatest and most complete creation
of the underglaze work.</p>

<p>It has been advanced, and on sure grounds,
that this Copenhagen blue-and-white porcelain,
with its continuity of national design extending
in unbroken line for over a century and a quarter,
is the largest service the world has seen. It
has grown by steady process of evolution into
thousands of well-defined forms, rich in inventive
modelling, and keeping abreast with modern
requirements, and it is to this day decorated with
the old pattern of the early days. This of itself
is an achievement not equalled by any other
factory. A Copenhagen breakfast set of the
twentieth century or a <i>t√™te-√†-t√™te</i> tea service can
stand beside eighteenth-century blue-and-white
porcelain from the same factory, and be in perfect
harmony in colour, in decoration, and in character.</p>

<p class="poem">Kindred and allied by birth,<br />
And made of the same clay.</p>

<p>The "Danish pattern" in blue was not long in
attracting copyists from other European factories.
To-day in Copenhagen itself English faience
transfer-printed in blue stands as a trade imitation
and a tribute to the genius and originality of its
prototype. Possibly the potter plagiarists may
never have heard of the pregnant words of Goethe:

<p><b>The Bornholm Clay Period.</b>&mdash;Mention has already
been made, in dealing with the early discoveries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
of M√ºller and the experiments he made, of
the clay which he found in the island of
Bornholm. This clay forms the body of some
of the earliest-known pieces made by him. It
may be readily recognized by its heavy weight
and by its grey tone. It is easy, after making
an examination of a great number of specimens
of the old blue-and-white ware, to distinguish
this Bornholm period, even although in the two
years (1773-1775) prior to the adoption of the
three blue lines as a factory mark, some pieces
bear no mark whatever. It somewhat resembles
certain heavy Japanese ware in its compact and
solid body and grey-blue colour.</p>

<p>The author has made a fairly exhaustive test
of several hundred pieces, both in public and in
private collections. The gradual development in
regard to the perfection of the paste and the glaze
is so noticeable that it is possible to place the
old blue-and-white fluted ware in successive grades
according to the stages of evolution. At first
coarse, though never meaningless nor offensive,
when the ware was obviously in an experimental
period, it betrayed fire-cracks and warpings in
form and slight departures from perfect symmetry.
Later it became whiter and thinner, and was
manifestly more completely under the control
of the potter. When the perfected period was
reached, there were tea caddies, pounce boxes,
and, in particular, certain dishes, of which an
example is illustrated (p. <a href="#Illus_169">169</a>) which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
unworthy to be compared favourably with specimens
of old blue-and-white Worcester of the
early period. There is a delicacy and refinement
in the modelling and potting, and that tenderness
in the glaze and thinness in the body which at
once betoken that the technique has been subjected
to the patient potter's control.</p>

<p><b>Peculiarities in Marking.</b>&mdash;For the first time
in any treatment of the subject, the potters and
modellers' marks are given in a table appended
to this chapter, which the writer hopes will be
found useful in identifying early examples. These
hieroglyphics, usually accompanied by the factory
mark of the three blue lines, are painters' marks,
and in the case of incised marks are representative
of the modellers or turners. It may be possible,
upon further research being given to the subject,
to identify the individual marks of each painter
or modeller, and thus arrive at some more definite
conclusion in regard to the date at which these
early blue-and-white pieces were made. But
until the exact list of painters at the factory,
together with the dates at which they were
employed, is subjected to exhaustive research,
it is obviously impossible to establish more than
the present series of marks, with limited conclusions
in regard to chronological order. The
marks now given have been specially drawn from
old examples of undoubted authenticity.</p>

<p>There is one peculiarity in connection with the
marks found on this early blue-and-white porcelain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
The bases are frequently ground, and the factory
mark of the three blue lines, with an accompanying
painter's mark, are on the base, with little
spots of glaze put over them no bigger than a
threepenny-piece. Another idiosyncrasy of Copenhagen
marks, not confined to the blue-and-white,
is the almost hidden position in which some of
the marks are found. In overglaze painted figures
the three blue lines will peep from beneath the
hem of some garment. In the blue-and-white
examples the mark is sometimes found on the
inside of the handle of a teapot or on a lid. In
some of the earlier pieces the blue mark has turned
to black under the action of the oven. Similarly,
in the early days of experiments in connection
with the perfecting of the blue, a series of plates
will be found of exactly the same decoration and
bearing the same painter's signature; but the
caprice of the fire, or the inexact knowledge of
the craftsman, has converted the blue of some
of them into a very deep blue, approaching black
in tone.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the old blue-and-white porcelain of Copenhagen
has not yet been exploited by collectors. It came concurrently with
the rich overglaze painting in colours and the magnificence of gilding
for which the M√ºller period is remarkable. It stands quite apart; its
decoration is underglaze, and not at that time, nor since, has gold
ever been added to this mussel-blue painted and fluted utilitarian
ware other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span> than in very exceptional circumstances. It is simple and
delightful, and what it was in the old days it is now. The style
of painted decoration is perennial. It is a pattern known all over
the world. It has lived for a hundred and thirty-six years. Its
life-history suggests the long-continued idealities of the Chinese
potter or the coloured intricacies of the Persian rug-weaver continued
by the wise children of clever craftsmen with equal fidelity from
generation to generation.</p>

<p class="chap_overview">Battle of Copenhagen, 1801&mdash;Nelson's Letters to Lady
Hamilton&mdash;The so-called Empire style&mdash;The Thorvaldsen
period.</p>


<p>The great days of the M√ºller <i>r√©gime</i> had come to
an end. A quarter of a century of brilliant success
was followed by twice that length of gloom. The
Arctic night of early nineteenth-century years
had settled on art. M√ºller's retirement in 1801
was not the only contributory cause of the
decadence of the factory. The French Revolution
had shaken Europe from end to end. The
Napoleonic Wars following in its wake disturbed
serenity and repose in art and letters. The
fortunes of States were in the melting-pot, and
destiny was "moulding men in plastic circumstance."
The storm cyclone had more than once
centred around Denmark. The century opened
ill for the fortunes of the factory. In April 1801<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
a British fleet entered the Sound and engaged
in a great naval battle with the Danish fleet.
"I have been in a hundred and five engagements,"
said Nelson, "but that of to-day is the most
terrible of them all." The genius of Napoleon
conceived the idea of "conquering the sea by the
land," to quote his own words. Paul I of Russia
became Napoleon's ally and tool. Russia brought
pressure to bear on Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia,
and these Powers were federated as the "League
of Armed Neutrality," with the avowed purpose
of challenging the maritime supremacy of England.
Prussia marched troops into Hanover. Russia
seized all British ships in Russian ports, and
every port from the North Cape to Gibraltar was
closed against the British flag. Behind this
combination was the brain of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The story of the battle is well known. The
Danes fought stubbornly. The love of the fatherland
and the flag, the split flag of old Denmark&mdash;the
<i>Dannebrog</i>&mdash;a white cross on a red field,
was stimulated by the poets of the day. Old
memories were awakened of the days of Juel,
Hvidfeldt, and Tordenskjold. Workmen, peasants
from the farms, and merchants from the city
hastened to enroll. The students of the university,
a thousand strong, enlisted to a man. The
Danish ships, supported by the shore batteries,
lay in the shallow waters of the Sound. The
attacking party had to navigate their ships through
narrow and dangerous shoals. On the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
towers and roofs hundreds of spectators watched
the great fight. There was a dearth of seamen.
In some of the vessels there was, so a Danish
account narrates, only one sailor in twenty.
These raw crews were kept at their drill throughout
the night prior to the battle.</p>

Copenhagen</p>
<p class="center">(<i>At Dansk Folke Museum, Copenhagen.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>Writing to the <i>Times</i> in 1801, an officer present
at the engagement says: "The enemy made a
very obstinate resistance and fought like brave
men. Most of our ships are very much cut up &hellip; and
the vessels which have been captured
are perfect sieves, there being hardly a single
plank in any one of them but has at least ten
shot-holes in it. In fact, it was the most dreadfully
fought action that ever took place in the
annals of history." Of the shattered prizes, only
one Danish vessel was fit to be repaired and taken
to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>It was at this battle, as every schoolboy knows,
that Nelson disregarded Admiral Parker's signal,
"I have only one eye," he said, turning to his
captain, "and may be allowed to be blind on
occasion." Placing the spy-glass to his blind eye
he said, "Upon my word, I do not see any
signal."</p>

<p>A young Danish officer, a lad of seventeen,
Villemoes, commanding a floating battery with
twenty-four men, stuck to his post till only
four of his men remained. Nelson, after the
battle, begged the Crown Prince to introduce
the young officer to him. The brave deeds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
two great fighting races stand out on that day
of awful carnage. Captain Larssen, after the
battle, when he appeared in the streets of Copenhagen,
was the object of universal homage as
the hero of Bloody Maundy Thursday. When
he passed Amagertorv, the fishwives would rise
and make him a deep curtsy. Yet he passed
his days in straitened circumstances and died
well-nigh forgotten. No statue commemorates
his memory.</p>

<p>But there is a ceramic record of that day of great
battle. We illustrate a Copenhagen porcelain
bowl, with painted scene, showing the <i>Dannebrog</i>
flying and the sea-fight in progress. It was given,
painted in colours, to the officers, and uncoloured
to the <i>sous-officiers</i> who fought on the 2nd of
April 1801. There is one at the <i>Dansk Folke
Museum</i> and another at Rosenborg Castle, and
the few other bowls in private hands are highly
treasured as heirlooms. It is inscribed on a
panel:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tilegnet<br />

friend and foe alike. There are many memories
of the Battle of the Baltic; many links of friendship
between the island kingdoms by the sea have
been forged since then.</p>

<p><b>Lord Nelson's Letters to Lady Hamilton.</b>&mdash;The
letters of Lord Nelson at that date have an
interesting reference to Copenhagen porcelain.
Apart from finding his portrait on Staffordshire
earthenware mugs and jugs as a national hero,
and commemorative of his victories, he took a
considerable pleasure in ceramic art. In 1802
he ordered a Worcester service, pieces of which
are found in the cabinets of collectors. His
letters frequently contain references to his china,
e.g.: "I send by the coach a little parcel containing
the keys of the plate-chest and the case of
the tea-urn, and there is a case of Colebrook
Dale breakfast set and some other things."</p>

</div></div>

<p>After the Battle of Copenhagen one of his letters
to Lady Hamilton is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>April 14, 1801.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>I was in hopes that I should have got off some Copenhagen
china to have sent you by Captain Bligh, who was one of my seconds
on the 2nd. He is a steady seaman, and a good and brave man.&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Another letter to Lady Hamilton, written on
the following day, runs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>St. George, April 15, 1801.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">My dearest Friend,</span><br />
</p>

<p>I can get nothing here worth your acceptance, but as I know
you have a valuable collection of china, I send you some of the
Copenhagen manufacture. It will bring to your recollection that here
your attached friend Nelson fought and conquered. Captain Bligh
has promised to take charge of it, and I hope it will reach you
safe.&hellip;</p>

<p>
Ever yours, most faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">Nelson and Bronte</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>At this date M√ºller had not retired from the
factory, and Nelson undoubtedly procured some
specimens of the best period. It is a matter of
conjecture as to whether these examples are now
known and in what collection in England they
may be found.</p>

<p>Hardly had the echoes of the booming guns
died away when Copenhagen was again bombarded
by a British fleet in 1807, and the Danish
fleet captured to prevent it falling into the hands
of Napoleon. A fire had consumed a quarter
of the city in 1795, and, succeeded by these later
calamities, produced a condition of considerable
distress and misery. The porcelain factory had
its share of disaster. Falling bombs did irreparable
damage: thousands of pounds' worth
of porcelain and moulds were destroyed. This
last blow was indeed a terrible one for the factory,
and helped to complete its ruin.</p>

<p><b>The so-called Empire Style.</b>&mdash;But there came another Continental
movement inimical to art in no less degree than war&mdash;the great
inventive spirit which produced the age of machinery. Art grew
impoverished and unfertile. Genius seemed to have descended on the
workshop and the loom. The painter, the designer, the creator of forms,
and the artist in colours lived in a nightmare of banalities. In regard
to England, this industrial revolution has been a most powerful factor
in stifling art. In Denmark, happily, this problem has not even yet
come with overwhelming force, as there are no mines, no copper, iron,
or coal, and the shadowy side of scientific invention and deadening
commerce has not darkened the artistic horizon.</p>

<p>In considering the ceramics of Denmark, it
should be borne in mind that, owing to an isolated
northern position, artistic movements affecting
the great European centres were slower in obtaining
a foothold in Copenhagen. This in a great
measure explains the steady growth of national
art on its own lines. It was not until 1824, when
G. Hetch became director, that the Copenhagen
factory commenced to produce designs, then
almost disappearing in other parts of Europe, in
the Empire style.</p>

<p>Count Caylus in France and Winckelmann in
Germany in middle eighteenth-century days had
heralded the oncoming classic movement which
had its <i>furore</i> of simplicity under the Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton and Wedgwood had carried
on the traditions in England. The Copenhagen
factory at this date followed the decoration of
Berlin and Vienna.</p>

<p><i>A Cup</i> of this period (1830-1840) is illustrated
(p. <a href="#Illus_185">185</a>). This cup is heavily gilded in the prevalent
atrocious style. It is finely painted in natural
colours, having a marine scene representing the
Castle of Kronborg, with the Sound, and a vessel
in full sail. It was here on the ramparts that
Hamlet met the ghost of his father. To-day the
Danish soldiers in blue uniform keep sentry-go
on the platform of the bastion. The bugle-call
echoes across the Sound, and the grey frowning
walls hold the mystery of the poet's dream.</p>

<p>One recalls Hamlet's vigil here, with his "The
air bites shrewdly, it is very cold," and Horatio's
reply, "It is a nipping and an eager air," and the
angry waves beating below and the gathering
storm from the north complete the picture.</p>

<p>We recollect the words&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">The king doth wake to-night, and takes his rouse,<br />
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;<br />
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out<br />
The triumph of his pledge.</p>

<p>And remembering, fall in a muse, to be aroused
by the note of the bugle and the clash of arms
of the guard.</p>

<p>Plates of this period show the heavy style that
had descended on the factory. Deep gold bands
enclose a circular picture, painted in a warm
brown colour by Garmein about 1820-1825. They
are mainly topographical in character. A plate
painted by Jensen is signed with
his initial, together with the three
blue lines as a factory mark (illustrated,
p. <a href="#Illus_189">189</a>). It is a fine flower-subject
in natural colours, representing primula,
blue flowers, and daffodil. The border is richly
gilded and has three distinct patterns; it evidently
has been used as an experimental piece. It is
now in the Museum at the royal
factory. There are other plates
painted in colours by L. Lyngbe,
in 1831 and 1833 respectively,
bearing his initial L. They are decorated in
rich gilding by Brandstrup. One represents S√∂roe
(with title on medallion), the Eton of Denmark.
The other is of Prince's Palace, Christiansborg,
Copenhagen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p><b>The Thorvaldsen Period.</b>&mdash;In 1867 the factory
came under the control of A. Falck, and the
director Holm, although not capable of raising
the artistic output to its old level, introduced a
new feature in a number of biscuit figures after
Thorvaldsen, the great Danish sculptor.</p>

<p>We reproduce the well-known figure of the god
<i>Mercury</i>, as indicating the beauty of these productions.
Interesting as they are, and undoubtedly
possessing great delicacy as replicas of masterpieces
of another art, the decadent note is still
present in denoting that the modellers had to
seek inspiration elsewhere. It is pleasurable to
be able to collect a miniature gallery of Thorvaldsen's
work in porcelain, but the potting and
modelling of them added nothing to the creative
faculty of the artists at the factory.</p>

<p>The only productions of importance now conducted
were an occasional jubilee or presentation
vase made from Hetch's old moulds, decorated
with a view of some villa or some edifice associated
with the person who ordered the vase. They
were usually covered with lilac or purple ground
and profusely gilded.</p>

<p>The flame had not gone out, but it was flickering
fitfully, and the artistic impulses in painting, and
the poetry that had never died in Denmark, were
stirring to kindle the fire into renewed life.</p>

<p>Since H√∂yen, the historian, delivered his lecture
in 1844 <i>On the Conditions for the Development of
a National Scandinavian Art</i>, artists had turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
homewards. There was the national spirit of the
northern people, the peasants and the fisher-folk,
to make the Danish <i>genre</i> picture. There was
nothing northern to be found in Rome. Eckersberg
had indicated the way, and with the study of
man came the study of nature. Johann Thomas
Lunbye, with his cattle and his forest landscapes,
caught the somnolent air of cattle before Troyon
had set the fashion in France. Peter Christian
Skovgaad interpreted the spiritual beauty of the
Danish beech-woods; his favourite light was the
cold pale day of the northern sky with its sober
blue. Kroyer, with his <i>Skagen Fishers at Sunset</i>,
and his <i>Fishermen setting out by Night</i>, surrounds
the <i>Dansk Folke</i> with mystery and poetry.</p>

<p>To these days belong the rejuvenation of Danish
art, and what the painter was doing on his canvas
the ceramic artist was shortly to do on his vase
and on his placque. The dawn of the Renaissance
was at hand.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the great Renaissance of art
which re-established the name and fame of the
Royal Copenhagen Factory, it is necessary to
look at the subject from more than one point
of view. The fire which M√ºller had lit had been
burning dimly; indeed, save for the blue-and-white
utilitarian ware, it had almost gone out.
The Copenhagen factory was a century old in
the seventies. Most of our English porcelain
factories had put out their furnaces for ever.
Chelsea, Derby, Plymouth, Bristol, and Bow
had entered that ghostly realm where collectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
snatch at the body of the potters and posterity
portions out the inheritance of the departed great.</p>

<p>The years of the English porcelain factories,
with their triumphs and their decadence, were
compassed within the span of a man's life. Plymouth
and Bristol, the only hard-paste factories,
together ran less than twenty years. Bow succumbed
in less than half a century. Chelsea
existed only thirty-nine years, and Derby, with
all its vicissitudes of fortune, changing hands
many times, never reached a century old. The
Worcester factory is the only English porcelain
factory in existence to-day with a history which
goes back to the middle years of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>The half-century from 1825 to 1875, not only in Copenhagen but in every
part of Europe, represents a dead level of banality in art. Sporadic
attempts to awaken enthusiasm or to stimulate public interest fell
on stony ground. Genius unrequited, and hardly recognized, consumed
its life energy in solitary grandeur in many a lonely furrow. The
period is bounded on the one side by the Napoleonic Wars, and on the
other by the Crimean War and by the Franco-Prussian War. In England,
artistic impulses were stifled by the rapid progress of the age of
machinery, led by the Manchester school of thought&mdash;Ricardo and John
Stuart Mill. A soil so sterile as this was incapable of producing
the highest artistic results. The treasuries of many of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
European Powers had been drained almost to depletion by vital wars, and
the little kingdom of Denmark had her share of political troubles. The
war-cloud had settled on the isthmus of Schleswig-Holstein. Prussia and
Austria and Denmark were whirled in a maelstrom of incessant warfare
concerning the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein. All the Great Powers
became involved. For forty years the struggle in one form or another
broke out anew like a smouldering fire. It was not until 1866 that the
Treaty of Vienna definitely assigned the future of the duchies to the
Powers. This is not the place to discuss the rights and wrongs of a
prolonged struggle by Denmark against more powerful neighbours, but
in consequence of the widespread arena of conflict, from Missunde to
Jutland, and the large war indemnity paid, it is manifest that the fine
arts came very near extinction in such troublous times, when blow upon
blow was rained upon the kingdom of Denmark.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the factory were at a low ebb,
as we have seen in dealing with the decadent
period. But in 1883 the models, stores, and
other effects of the factory were sold to the limited
company "Aluminia." From this date a new
future commenced for the factory.</p>

<p><b>Philip Schou rebuilds the Factory.</b>&mdash;The hour
demanded the man, and the man was Philip
Schou, who came as the pioneer of modernity.
In the outskirts of the capital, close to the park<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
of the Castle of Frederiksberg, large buildings
were erected, containing workshops provided with
the latest improvements in machines and kilns
of the newest designs. The ovens were much
larger than the older type, and designed to hold
about 15,000 pieces of average size. These drastic
changes at the dawn of the Renaissance, entirely
due to the foresight of Schou, necessitated the
expenditure of a considerable amount of money.
It is not surprising to find that during the first
years the undertaking, from a financial point
of view, did not prove successful. This, at the
time, except to Schou, may not have been recognized
as the happiest omen, but it is a postulate
that art and commercialism do not usually thrive
together. It was the same in M√ºller's day; it
has always been an admitted fact, and it always
will be acknowledged that the cloven hoof of
commercialism has marked the oncoming of a
decadent period. But Philip Schou had ambitions
and desires which no reverses could thwart. His
practical grasp of the situation and his perspicacious
conception of future possibilities, which
have now been realized, stamp him as a man
possessed of that rare combination of poetry
and practicability which marks the pioneer of
any great enterprise.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There are triumphs of great business organization
which compel our admiration in no less
degree than artistic achievements won in equally
adverse conditions. To build up the decayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
fortunes of a moribund art, to combat financial
disaster and impending ruin, require indomitable
courage and intensity of application which cannot
be classed other than as genius.</p>

<p>The great period of M√ºller and the great
triumphs were sinking into oblivion. Of the
once famous factory it seemed as though little
might be left but the name. The old models of
beautiful symmetry had long been set aside or
even destroyed. The favourite blue-and-white
service, the national pattern treasured as the
remaining heirloom, had lost all its style and
harmony. Haphazard conditions prevailed and
slovenly results predominated. Originality had
taken wing and deserted the old factory. The
old mussel design was painted on any form
that found its way into Denmark from other
factories. Copenhagen was content to follow,
and leave art and prestige to take care of themselves.
Now and again artistic productions, such
as a wedding or a jubilee vase made from the
old moulds, like milestones, marked the road.
With this material, with its poverty of art and
paucity of ideas, the new director, shrewd and
energetic, saw that no headway could be made.
A demand for artistic and original decoration of
articles of domestic use and luxury was just
making itself felt, and there was some talk of
creating a national Christian VI style. But the
factory has accomplished something greater&mdash;it
has created a European style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>The early days of the factory, with its new
impulses and its youthful spirit of modernity,
are reflected at once in the first attempts to
inaugurate something of artistic and permanent
value. The comparison between Schou and
M√ºller holds good in many respects. They both
were men in advance of their day. They were
builders, not only in the sense of being pioneers
of an artistic industry, but in the practical sense
of laying down ovens and expending money on
valuable plant as a means to the great end
they had in view. The struggle against adversity,
the accumulating cloud of financial losses, the
want of outside support, are common factors in
both these men's sturdy fight against failure.
M√ºller had to combat the inheritance of failure
left by Fournier, and Philip Schou had to
overcome the deathly inertia that had paralysed
the factory during the decadence. It is not
easy to find co-operation in face of a general
tendency in an opposite direction. Mediocre
minds find it more congenial to float unconcernedly
with the stream. Schou was the strong
swimmer fighting against the current.</p>

<p>There is one other point where he claims kinship
with M√ºller; he was felicitous in the selection of
his lieutenants, and his choice of artistic assistance
to further his ambitions was as wise as it was
phenomenally prescient.</p>

<p><b>Arnold Krog appointed Art Director.</b>&mdash;In 1885
Arnold Krog became an artist at the factory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
Trained as an architect and a painter, he had
already spent five years in the restoration of
Frederiksborg Castle, and like those old Italian
craftsmen who made all art their domain, he
came to the decoration of porcelain with instinctive
appreciation of its qualities.</p>

<p>A happier combination than this could not
have been desired. Schou, the business head,
the man of strength of purpose, tenacity of will,
battling with stern facts and figures, and Arnold
Krog, the artist and dreamer, inventing new
forms, wrestling with technical problems with
a practical skill wedded to poetic impulses.</p>

<p>The days of early Renaissance were filled with
eager incessant work, and whatever difficulties
surged up to the doors of the factory, Schou
resisted them bravely. He believed in the future
of the factory, he believed in the work of the
artists. It was this great proud belief of a great
man in his life's work that created the second
great period in the history of the Royal Copenhagen
Porcelain Factory. This quotation from
a fellow-worker of that date shows how lovingly
his memory is still cherished: "Optimistic and
broad-minded man as he was, he firmly believed
that the factory would succeed in spite of all
difficulties. He did not look for immediate profit,
but left us to work in peace, undisturbed by
all the anxieties and pecuniary difficulties with
which he, as managing director, must have had
to contend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p><b>A New Technique developed.</b>&mdash;In regard to the direction in
decoration which the new porcelain took, it is interesting to realize
how distinct a departure this was from contemporary art. The moment
that Arnold Krog awakened to the fact that the body of the porcelain is
smooth, white, hard, and of surpassing beauty, that moment determined
its future. To cover it with colours or with gold in the overglaze
style, as his predecessors had done, was at once to extinguish its
innate loveliness. If blue dots and lines could be painted on plates,
surely, thought the new art director, other artistic designs could
be produced in the same manner. From these premises the principle
of underglaze painting was accepted, and has been since followed so
successfully.</p>

<p>The determination of the method employed
immediately led to the inquiry as to the exact
definition such painting was to take. The difficulty
now was to decide what to paint. It was
obvious that mere ornamentation would lead to
nothing new. Could Europe teach Copenhagen
anything? It apparently could, at that stage.
Accordingly, Philip Schou and Arnold Krog made
a tour of Holland, Belgium, France, and England,
and visited many of the leading factories. At
the Antwerp Exhibition they saw many beautiful
things from S√®vres and the other great European
factories, but they had to admit that their journey
was in a great measure fruitless, as they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
discover what they sought&mdash;new impulses for
original work.</p>

<p>It was not enough that all traditional arabesques
and scrolls should be discarded: the plain white
resplendent surface of the ware demanded its
place in the scheme of decoration.</p>

<p>At Paris, Arnold Krog visited the collection of
M. S. Bing, who had just returned with rich
treasures of Oriental art from China and Japan.
These masterpieces in bronze, earthenware, porcelain,
and ivory, together with drawings and colour-prints
with endless variety of composition, brought
with them an atmosphere of ancient culture,
artistic genius, and unerring instinct, and to the
mind capable of unlocking the mysteries of the
old unexplored East they revealed their secret.</p>

<p>The immediate results indicate clearly enough
that Copenhagen had not "jumped a claim"
and found treasure-trove upon which she could
live till others gained the secret. There was no
slavish imitation of the designs of the Oriental
potter, as was the case with S√®vres and with
Worcester. With true vision, the results of the
East were traced to the original source of inspiration,
and henceforth Nature in all her forms,
in all her varying phases and moods, became
the mirror into which Copenhagen looked to see
herself reflected.</p>

<p>With such an ideal before the factory there
was work enough for all and much to be accomplished.
The records of this period show the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
incessant labours of all concerned in building
anew the fortunes of the factory. Liisberg the
sculptor was appointed modeller, and a young
apprentice, Hallin, was made his assistant. The
extreme difficulty of the technique offered frequent
disappointments. The tone is determined by the
exact thickness of the layer of pigment applied,
and it is impossible to distinguish between the
different shades before the firing has taken place.
The only guide in this work is a fine instinct.
But the enthusiasm of the little band of workers,
modellers and artists, was not damped by the
vagaries of the furnace. With little enough by
way of precedent to guide them, they attained
a sure and unerring technique and a complete
mastery over the idiosyncrasies of the medium in
which they worked. These early years of intense
application have created traditions for the factory,
and the days of Philip Schou stand as never to
be forgotten in the strenuous outburst of initiative
industry which has raised a monument to Danish
handicraft and culture. In 1902 Philip Schou
resigned his position as managing director, and
it is pleasurable to record that in a full and complete
life he has seen his early dreams realized.
He received decoration at the hands of foreign
Governments, and in 1888 was made a knight-commander
of the Legion of Honour. Copenhagen
porcelain had won European distinction,
being acclaimed as adding new impulses and
teaching a new technique to the older factories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>The early successes of the porcelain were as
surprising to the leading experts of Europe as
they were gratifying to the pioneers of the Copenhagen
Renaissance. It is an interesting fact that
the first piece painted in underglaze colours was
bought in September 1885 by the Duke of Sutherland,
whose yacht was lying in the Sound. The
Duke paid a visit to the royal factory, and
although at that time only three pieces were
finished, he carried off a specimen decorated with
a stork flying over a lake. Such an historic
piece as this is now worth a considerable sum.</p>

<p><b>Triumph of Modern Copenhagen Porcelain.</b>&mdash;At
the great International Exposition at Paris in
1889, the Royal Copenhagen exhibit attracted
unusual attention. Although the factory was not
then in a position to make a grand show of large
or costly pieces, French collectors and connoisseurs
besieged the show-cases, and the demand far
exceeded the supply, ten times the price asked
being offered in many instances by disappointed
collectors. Within fourteen days of the opening
of the Exhibition everything of any artistic value
was sold. Coupled with this commercial success
came the award of the <i>Grand Prix d'honneur</i>, a
rare distinction at that time, especially for so
small an undertaking.</p>

<p>At this Exhibition the coloured crystalline
glazes were shown for the first time. These,
now so well known in the adoption by most of
the leading factories of the world, were discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
in 1886 by Clement, the chemist at the Royal
Copenhagen Factory, and perfected by his successor,
Hr. Engelhardt. (This crystalline ware is
dealt with separately in Chapter X.)</p>

<p>The days of the early Renaissance were full of promise&mdash;a promise
that has not been unfulfilled. The old factories, with traditions of
a century and a half, threw off their lethargy at the trumpet-blast
of modernity. The Copenhagen factory was like the fairy prince of
the romantic tale who blew the magic horn and awakened the sleeping
princesses.</p>

<p><b>The New Impulses stimulate other European
Potters.</b>&mdash;Art criticism of this period abounds in
glowing tribute. M. Edouard Garnier, one of
the directors of the S√®vres factory, wrote in the
<i>Gazette des Beaux Arts</i> in 1889: "Not one of the
foreign porcelain factories which in 1878 threatened
to become dangerous rivals to us seems to have
made any progress; on the other hand, the beautiful
exhibits of the Royal Porcelain Factory of Copenhagen
are quite a revelation to us: they show
quite a new spirit in the art of porcelain-making."</p>

<p>Among the varied developments at this time
considerable attention was given to the form of
the blue-and-white "mussel"-painted ware, and
a wonderful variety of shapes followed each other
in quick succession. All the old artificial and
oftentimes meaningless designs which had crept
in during the decadent period were discarded,
and were replaced by tasteful and natural designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
which were conceived with a view to the characteristic
lines in their decoration. The great
and wonderful inventiveness and rich variety of
this table ware in its thousand forms are therefore
the consummation of the incessant search for truth
and symmetry and beauty which characterized
the early Renaissance period.</p>

<p>If proof be needed of the great influence Copenhagen
art exercised on contemporary ceramics,
the proof is ready to hand. Just eleven years
after the Paris Exposition of 1889 came the great
Exposition of 1900, and an examination of the
<i>grand-feu</i> specimens of the S√®vres factory shows
to what extent the delicate tones of the new Copenhagen
technique in underglaze painting had affected
the French potters. Crystalline glazes had by
this time been developed. In 1894 M. Edouard
Garnier, of the National factory at S√®vres, in
again passing judgment upon the work of Copenhagen,
refers to the fact that two specimens
exhibiting "marvellous skill in the execution"&mdash;the
<i>Flight of the Sparrows</i> and the <i>Lilacs</i>&mdash;were
bought for inclusion in the modern collection of
ceramic art of the S√®vres Museum, and to this
museum Hr. Philip Schou sent the first specimens
of varied colorations "<i>au grand feu</i>" and the
experiments made by Hr. Engelhardt of full or
partial crystallized glazes.</p>

<p>In regard to the general atmosphere of the
<i>grand-feu</i> ceramics, the S√®vres factory had by
1900, the year of the Exhibition, turned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
such fond eyes to Copenhagen that the results
then offered, triumphs though they were, reflected
something more than usual of the Northern spirit.
For instance, one remembers the two great biscuit
groups in hard porcelain for table decoration at
the √âlys√©e, by Fr√©miet, the master sculptor.
These were 4 feet 8 inches in height, and were
marvels of fabrication. The one was the Athenian
<i>Minerva</i>, and the other the Scandinavian <i>Diana</i>
standing in her chariot, with a hound at her
feet and driving two reindeer. These were the
first pieces of so great a size ever made in biscuit
at S√®vres. Figures of Northern animals followed
the success of the factory by the Baltic, and there
was one, a <i>Wolf</i> tracing human steps in the snow,
by M. Valton, which won commendation. Nor
was this all. The grey tones were successfully
reproduced in the <i>Danish Dogs</i>, by Gardet.</p>

<p>There is no greater tribute to pay to the inspiring
genius behind the Royal Copenhagen
Factory than to enumerate these instances of old
factories with the prestige of S√®vres and Meissen
hailing the newly awakened spirit of a younger
factory. On every side, in these days, came the
tribute of praise generously given by masters
of technique and by rival workers in art. The
Renaissance was something more than a name&mdash;it
had become an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>The great achievement of the modern Renaissance
period is the creation of a new technique
in underglaze decoration, which has added something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
to modern European ceramic art. The
underglaze blue, employed at the old royal factory
by M√ºller, was familiar from early Meissen days.
But the revelation that underglaze painting of
landscape had become something more romantic
than Chinese prototypes was a fact only realized
after Copenhagen had made successful experiment.
The landscape of the Oriental potter, at the best,
had something of formality and followed a convention
alien to Western laws of perspective.
Differing essentially from the enamel colours of
the overglaze Continental work, and not less so
from the glost-kiln colours of the English factories
in their underglaze work, the <i>grand-feu</i> colours,
with their scheme of harmonies imparted something
fresh and original to the art of the modern
potter.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, of great interest, commingled
with considerable speculation, to contemplate the
various stages of evolution of this characteristic
style, and to await the future phases of its development.</p>

<p>In reviewing the work of this Renaissance period,
an attempt has been made by the writer to arrive
at some conclusion as to that exact point of time
at which the genius of the factory reaches its
whitest heat during a brilliant quarter of a century
of work. In a rich field of design which exhibits
so much character and freshness, when new
surprises may come forth from the oven at
any moment, no inconsiderable difficulty presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>
itself in selecting any period where the work is
more excellent.</p>

<p>Happily, in contemplating the underglaze productions
of Copenhagen, there is an extended
period which may be passed in review. It is
perhaps natural, when making tests of the general
output of work, to select the middle years as
productive of ceramic art of the highest order.
There is the advantage in point of date of being
able to apply a standard to it, either side by side
with earlier work, or in comparison with later
creations in the same style of decoration by the
same band of artists and modellers.</p>

<p>The number and character of the decorative
pieces produced at the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain
Factory during the ten years from 1896 to 1905,
to which the highest praise has been given, seem
to indicate that a close investigation of the
details of the work of the individual modellers
and artists might with advantage be pursued by
those cosmopolitan collectors intent on acquiring
masterpieces representative of the highest modern
ceramic art.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Personal tastes and predilections are not unimportant
factors in passing judgment upon the
present-day work of the factory, but the authorities
of museums in various parts of the world, whose
standard is a high one, have not hesitated in
selecting modern examples of Royal Copenhagen
porcelain. In following the trend of the development
of the porcelain since the great outburst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
in 1900, when at the Paris Exhibition by general
acclamation Copenhagen was acknowledged to
be ahead of all other European factories, disinterested
critics and less disinterested competitors
have eagerly watched the progress of the Danish
ware. Art requires no passport to cross international
barriers, and foreign experts have enthusiastically
admitted that the work of Copenhagen
is of surprising beauty. At successive exhibitions,
when nation has stood in friendly rivalry with
nation, the ceramic record of Copenhagen has
not been dimmed by equal work. So far it is
still in advance of every one in Europe. Imitators
it has, and, as the old adage puts it, "imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery."</p>

<p>The question is always asked of factories "with a past," whether it
be S√®vres or Meissen, Wedgwood or Worcester&mdash;Is the work of to-day
an echo of past glories, has the lamp burned dim, is the sacred fire
still alight? In regard to other factories this is not the place to
make any pronouncement, nor is it impossible to say that at any moment
the spirit of the presiding genius of these great factories with great
traditions may awaken to inspire anew the modern potters upon whom
the mantle of succession has fallen. To cover European factories in a
survey is often to come upon silent and deserted temples with decrepit
worshippers offering sacrifices to a dim and distant past. But the
oracle may yet speak.</p>

<p>It is here that Copenhagen, with its great period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
of overglaze work, under the M√ºller <i>r√©gime</i>, holding
equality with the great factories of its day, as
we have shown in earlier chapters, now comes
forward with a second great period of underglaze
work, bearing no immediate relationship with the
first. Holger Danske has awakened to give magic
potency to the Danish art.</p>

<p>The following are the chief characteristics of
Royal Copenhagen porcelain. It is always hard
fired <i>au grand feu</i>, and the various classes of the
underglaze decorated ware may be summarized
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>Underglaze Painted</h3>

<p>I. <i>Individual Pieces.</i></p>

<p>Vases and placques signed by the artists who
have painted them. Such unique specimens of
personal work are never reproduced.</p>

<p>(A list of artists, with facsimile reproductions of
their signatures, will be found at the end of this
chapter.)</p>

<p>II. <i>General Art Objects.</i></p>

<p>Vases, placques, bibelots, and ornamental
subjects.</p>

<p>These are designed with a view to general
production, and this practice has originated since
1893.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In this class may be included the collection of
Commemorative Placques designed by Arnold
Krog. The number struck of these is limited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
and they are never repeated after the occasion
for which they were made (see p. <a href="#Illus_243">243</a>).</p>

<p>More strictly utilitarian ware is represented by
the continuous output of the blue-and-white
fluted service, to which new forms are constantly
being added.</p>

<p>III. <i>Figure Subjects.</i></p>

<p>Peasants, children, and animal life&mdash;quadrupeds,
birds, and fish&mdash;all modelled directly from nature.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Vases and Modelled Subjects with Coloured or
Crystallized Glazes.</i></p>

<p>This style was commenced at Copenhagen as
early as 1886, and is described in detail, Chapter X.</p>


<h3>Overglaze Painted Porcelain</h3>

<p>Revival of porcelain in the style of the Juliane
Marie period, modelled and decorated from old
and rare examples. This is the latest phase of
development.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In tabulated form some conception may be
formed as to the classes into which the work of
the modern Renaissance may be divided. Something
must be said about the immediate causes
which directed the line of progression and advancement
in the course it has taken.</p>

<p>The principles of decoration especially applying
to porcelain, smooth, white, and hard, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
this, have been realized to the full by Arnold
Krog, the art director of the factory.</p>

<p>The uttermost developments of the underglaze
painting are governed by the axiom that such
a fine body as that of the Copenhagen porcelain
is instantly destroyed by being covered with
colours or with gilding. The old Danish mussel-blue
painted underglaze dinner ware is the skeleton
upon which the fabric of the modern Renaissance
movement has been built.</p>

<p><b>The Avoidance of Classic or Stereotyped Styles.</b>&mdash;Something of
the forcefulness of the originality of Copenhagen may be gathered from
a brief hypothetical survey of what divergent paths design might have
taken even at that critical moment when it was determined to employ the
underglaze colours for decorative landscape subjects. The conventional
panel might have been still employed, and with it the formal scenes
of gardens with cavaliers and ladies, bringing the Chinese landscape
subject into Western perspective, and at the same time eschewing the
vivid colours of S√®vres or Meissen. Or underglaze painting, in blue
and the other <i>grand-feu</i> colours, might have found itself in panels
supplemented by overglaze enamel colours of bright tone, in floral
decoration, or <i>≈ìil-de-perdrix</i> and other luscious patterns, and
richly gilded. It might, not unnaturally, have appeared to be a safer
beginning to develop the Danish conventional pattern into something
more intricate in design,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span> with geometrical borders and formal
floral painting or with old Scandinavian interlaced designs of Runic
character, exhibiting the newer advance of underglaze treatment.</p>

<p>Copenhagen, with wise rejection, took none
of these courses, and the Renaissance leapt into
being not only with new applications of underglaze
painting, but with a complete and rapidly
perfected theory wherein the subject became a
ceramic poem. Throwing all convention to the
winds, it brought tone to underglaze painting,
and within the limits of the potter's technique,
the same relative atmospheric quality to the
decorated vase or placque as there is on the canvas
of the painter.</p>

<p>The porcelain found itself in an incredibly
short time, and rapidly passed through its initial
stages. The first light had come from the East.
The influx into Europe of some of the finest art
work of Japan had a marked effect on design.</p>

<p>But Krog's genius was too original to snatch
at the body; he caught the spirit of the best, and
the first attempts have a slight indication of
their origin, till with full strength Copenhagen
needed no guiding hand to lead her to the inspiration
of all true design. The simple forms of
nature were translated into ceramic art, and the
melting, dreamy, sad-hued porcelain was imbued
with the subtle effects of the Danish landscape.
The great simplicity of <i>motif</i> was the great simplicity
of genius. The effects are so natural and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>
reticent that their greatness might well escape
common observation. But the trained eyes of
half the potters in Europe and of connoisseurs of
the highest ceramic art were turned, and are
turned still, to the output of the Copenhagen
factory. <i>Summa ars est celare artem</i> is eminently
applicable to the art of Arnold Krog and the band
of Danish artists trained under him. There is
nothing showy or clever, nothing cheap or meretricious
in all their work. Everything that has
come from Krog's hands has been well conceived,
and an honest attempt made not to win admiration
but to make one step forward in artistic evolution
towards the ideal. Without seeking reward he
has won the esteem of the cultured critics of a
whole continent.</p>

<p><b>The Idiosyncrasies of Copenhagen.</b>&mdash;Wherein lies
the strength of Copenhagen porcelain? The
mysteries of underglaze did not originate in
Denmark. The blue, greenish-yellow, brown, sea-green,
maroon, lemon-colour, celadon-green, and
red, are colours found painted under the glaze
in old Chinese examples in collections in various
European museums. But there is a difference.
Chinese landscapes in blue have a charm and
atmosphere of their own, although the European
taste has shown a marked preference for enamel-painted
porcelain of more brilliant colours. The
underglaze of the East was mainly confined to
decorative conventional treatment. There is the
exquisite family of jars, designed as presents at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span>
the New Year, painted underglaze, with the
prunus blossom, and geometric pattern representing
the breaking ice. These are grotesquely
termed "ginger jars" in the jargon of the auction-room,
and fine specimens bring immense prices
under the hammer. In a measure these, and
vases and beakers with floral decoration, and cups
and saucers, with dragons or with the well-known
"aster" pattern, may be regarded as conventional.
From these prototypes Meissen and S√®vres and
Worcester drew many fine inspirations.</p>

<p>In underglaze blue painting there is another
class with landscapes and figures, such as bowls,
of which there are infinite variety, which convey,
in lieu of regular ornament, a certain atmosphere.
Even the ordinary ginger jar of commerce, if it
be old enough, exhibits a most alluring suggestiveness.
These designs appear to be traditional on
common ginger jars half a century apart in point
of time. There is a background of mountains,
and stretch of sky with a triangular flight of birds,
flying high. There is a tree in the foreground,
and a rustic homestead. On a bank a fisherman
casts a line into the water, and away on the expanse
of lake stands a junk. The whole is crudely and
hastily drawn, and one jar, if not exactly the
counterpart of another, has the same details in
the scene. But, curiously enough, there is a
poetry and depth of tone about these common
ginger jars which is difficult to define.</p>

<p>To arrive at a technical reason for these differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span> in styles is
to examine the theories governing the art of ceramics. To take the
overglaze painting; this may be compared to the canvas of the painter
which is covered with pigment. His sky is blue or red or yellow or
an admixture of all three; the reflections of light on the water are
touches of pigment. There is no part of the canvas over which his deft
brush has not travelled. The underglaze painter on porcelain is like
the etcher, who obtains his illumination from the uncovered surface of
the copper upon which he works. The untouched portion of the plate of
the etcher forms the wide expanse of sky, and gives luminosity to the
deeply bitten lines of his subject. Similarly, in underglaze painting
on porcelain, the dazzling white expanse of the body, afterwards to be
coated with limpid transparent glaze, is the background into which the
design of the artist must imperceptibly melt. It is this depth of tone
and atmosphere which give poetic charm to underglaze painting.</p>

<p>But the <i>subject</i> is not left to take care of itself.
Without pictorial indefinition the work may still
remain on the plain of formal decoration even
though that be superlatively conceived and
executed.</p>

<p>What is it that one sees when one comes face
to face for the first time with a Copenhagen vase
of this golden period? The merest dilettante in
porcelain-collecting must at once recognize something
that he will find nowhere else in his cabinets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
In form there is always, necessarily, a full expanse
to carry the subject, if it be landscape. Nor is
there a front and a reverse, as in the old school
of conventionally treated landscapes circumscribed
by panels. There is a breadth and continuity
of subject traversing the circumference
of the vase, which, from new points of view, offers
new surprises.</p>

<p>The body is white and hard and of ivory-like
closeness when seen by transmitted light. The
rich liquid glaze has a slight greenish tone and
has a surface like polished crystal. The quality
of this glaze is exceptionally fine and possesses
artistic properties peculiarly its own. In modelled
subjects such as fish this is especially noticeable.
In the noble figure of a <i>Sea Lion</i>, this glaze simulates
the original so skilfully that the sensation
conveyed is exactly that of the smooth, sleek,
satin-like texture of that animal's body. It is
obvious that with such a vehicle as this glaze
the effects produced in landscape painting are
those seen in nature in the sun-pierced vaporous
haze of a climate remarkable for its exquisite tones.</p>

<p>In colour the subjects appear in low tones of
subtle elusiveness, never, by reason of the technique
of the underglaze palette, departing from
the strictly limited range of colours we have
enumerated. The tones of all these are pitched
in a minor key. The brilliance of the painter in
enamel is conspicuously absent. There is no
scarlet, or bright yellow, or mazarin blue, or vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
green. The charm of colour lies in its exquisite
delicacy. It is the highest ceramic landscape
painting offered to the delectation of those possessed
of sufficient connoisseurship to appreciate
the supreme handling of a difficult technique.</p>

<p>It departs from the Chinese prototypes in underglaze
blue. The deep blue of Nankin is delightful
in its poetry, but it is a convention that landscapes
are painted all blue. Copenhagen becomes
more realistic, but no less poetical, with added
touches of amber, and mauve, and grey, and sage
green, and the blue, pale and tender, carries out
a colour scheme which stamps this Western art
as something original and ideal.</p>

<p>It is thus seen that in body and glaze and colouring Copenhagen has
excellent points challenging comparison with anything that has gone
before. But with these technical problems solved satisfactorily,
there is yet something to be added, which has created a reflective
school of design and elevated Copenhagen to its present status. This
quality, difficult to describe, and yet ever-present in the results
when submitted to definite criticism, may be roughly summarized as
consisting of two essential traits of disciplined art&mdash;the apt choice
of decorative subject and the complete mastery exercised in fittingly
decorating the object.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Apart from the technical excellence of selection
of idea and symmetrical incorporation with the
form under decoration, there is the national spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
which is the soul imparted to the work of artists
filled with intense love of nature. This charm,
lightly and daintily woven into the dreams
which the porcelain conveys in dim mysterious
manner, cannot be captured by the snare of the
imitator.</p>

<p>The Western potter hitherto had not quite
realized that he must be a poet as well as a potter.
To study Copenhagen porcelain is to read poetry
conveyed in another medium than printing-ink
and paper. Nor is this new of the highest ceramic
art. To contemplate old Chinese porcelain is
not to think in poetry but to speak in poetry.
Great potters have twin souls the world over.
The Chinese themselves have terms for their own
ware which indicate the plane on which all great
ceramic art should stand. To one colour is given
the term "the moonlight," to another "the blue
of the prune skin," to another "the violet of the
wild apple," to another "the liquid dawn," to
yet another "the red of the bean blossom."
Descriptions of certain ware and certain colours
and glazes become little poems, such as the account
of the Ch'ai Yao&mdash;"As blue as the sky, as clear
as a mirror, as thin as paper, and as resonant as
a musical stone of jade." Nor is Chinese literature
wanting in reiterated allusions to the beauty
of the national porcelain. The wine cups are
likened to "disks of thinnest ice" or to "tilted
lotus leaves floating down a stream."</p>

<p>The strain of poetry, so pronouncedly a feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
in modern Copenhagen work, is noticeable even
in the old overglaze decorated porcelain. The
innate love of nature found expression in its
refusal to follow stereotyped forms of ceramic
decoration. The national note never departed
except during the decadence. The <i>Flora Danica</i>
service, with its stiff and painstaking decorations
in botanical style, was a monument to national
ceramic art. The modern spirit, with its landscape
and realism, is crystallized in a great gallery
of placques and vases, and may be said to embody
the <i>Poetica Danica</i>&mdash;the new interpretation of
nature. The flowers are no longer botanical
specimens pressed between the pages of a ceramic
album. They are painted <i>in situ</i>, and become
delicate units in dream pictures, beside still lakes
or embosomed in grassy dells.</p>

<p><b>Intense National Sentiment of Copenhagen Style.</b>&mdash;The
Renaissance period is at once national and
reflective of the moods of the land of its origin.
The illustrations appearing in this chapter faintly
suggest the luminosity of the originals, but in
their selection an attempt has been made to show
that a certain ordered progress has been at work.
The earlier examples are significant of the lingering
traces of Oriental suggestion, rapidly and
completely assimilated, and any mannerism, if
such there be, was pushed aside by the native
growth of vigorous inventiveness and the rich
profusion of forms and designs not dependent on
any outside influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>To compare Japanese art with that of Copenhagen
is to compare two parallel lines which only
meet in infinity and never coincide. Truth and
sincerity, love of nature, and mastery of form
are common to the Japanese and the Danish
ceramists. But the former reflect the brilliance
of colour harmonies of a land teeming with rich
colour and steeped in Oriental tradition. The
mirror is held to national life and sentiment,
and accordingly movement, humour, poetry, are
essentials in Japanese pottery.</p>

<p>The art of Copenhagen equally reflects the
national life and character under a northern sky.
Pensive, dreamy, tinged with the stillness of
the Arctic night, with its violet sky, the wistful
art of the North never attempts the sensuous
moments of the art of the Far East. The beauty
of form is reticent and reposeful. The range of
the <i>grand-feu</i> colours coincides exactly with the
tender colours of the little kingdom, and the
melting glaze adds that luminosity which makes
the Danish landscape so <i>spirituelle</i>.</p>

<p>Danish art has never attempted to be Japanese;
on the other hand, Japan has seriously
realized that the art of Copenhagen is worth
the copying, and has done this with a light
heart.</p>

<p>Again and again one is struck with the originality of a design new
to ceramic decoration. The <i>Placque</i>, of the period 1896 to 1900
(illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_207">207</a>), is a case in point, and is almost the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
instance of a dallying with the romantically artificial. But the effect
is so charming and so poetical that it disarms criticism. What could
promise so little as a subject for decorative treatment? A pair of iron
gates, flanked with stone pillars surmounted by formal urns. An avenue
of poplars approached by the ascending steps of a terrace, stretching
from the foreground in two converging lines, with the solitary figure
of a woman in black in the middle distance. That is all. But the result
is an alluring picture of an old-world chateau. A touch of Southern
elegance and courtly grace makes itself evident in the formal scene,
with its pathos of the figure symbolizing lonely sorrow and the dark
shadow of the chapel at the end of the grove.</p>

<p>It is possible, without eliminating much, to
trace the steady growth of temperamental art
during a quarter of a century in successive stages
of five years. True to first impelling motives,
the art of the factory has never turned back.
The modern movement known as <i>l'art nouveau</i>,
which swept across Europe with its meaningless
swirls and curves, left no trace on the work of the
Royal Copenhagen Factory. Rich in the possession
and eager in the fulfilment of its own original
conceptions, it had no need of extraneous impulses,
and has remained unstirred by ephemeral
art movements. The illustrations in this chapter
are arranged chronologically as far as possible,
and it will be seen that the subjects become as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
Danish as the ballad of King Christian. The
gallery is rich in its dreamy suggestiveness, the
ceramic record of reposeful scenes luxuriating in
luscious somnolence&mdash;the sea, the sand-dunes,
the wild swans, and geese, and mallards, the wood
with its deer and wild life, the secluded lake with
its denizens, the meadows, and the cattle of the
farm lands.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There has been a process of fermentation going
on in modern Danish pictorial art, and its influence
is seen on the porcelain produced at the
royal factory. It is new because it is everlastingly
old&mdash;the worship of Nature. There is
in modern Copenhagen porcelain the tender,
dreamy melancholy of the old Danish ballads.
It is like some magic story told in the twilight.
Everything is silent, nebulous, steeped in fragrant
yet pathetic memories. There is a subtle and
refined introspection, an √¶sthetic yearning akin
to sadness.</p>

<p>Every Dane remembers Jacobsen's whimsical
visionary Mogens, who hums softly to himself
the refrain&mdash;"<i>I L√§ngsel, I L√§ngsel jeg lever!</i>"
(Longing, longing I live!).</p>

<p>This tristful ideality is a note in literature not
far to seek. The Danish poets have reflected
Nature's moods with throbbing ecstasy, tinged
with sombre forebodings. It comes with unexpected
pathos as an ending to Christian
Winther's poem <i>En Vandrer</i> (A Wanderer), who,
after a pilgrimage through woodland glades of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
summerland, exclaims at the sight of the cloud-capped
mountains in the distance&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Og&mdash;naar de er bestegne<br />
Imorgen&mdash;ak!&mdash;hvad saa?</i></p>

<blockquote><p>(And when they are climbed, to-morrow, alas! what then?)</p></blockquote>

<p>The outlook of the Copenhagen potter-artists
reflects the genius of inspired vision. The face
of Nature is transfigured. This interpretation
links poesy and pensive art indissolubly together
in these ceramic poems palpitating with sensitiveness.</p>

<p>A touch of tender melancholy pervades the
art of the potter. He has caught the pale green
of the sea, the vibrating light on the long sand
dunes and the silvery vaporous clouds that fret
the horizon. To take a Copenhagen vase with
its sea-scape and dancing spray and pack of
scudding storm-clouds, tempts one to place it
to one's ear as children do sea-shells; surely one
shall hear the sound of the leaping surge and the
roll of the breakers!</p>

<p>Bathed in liquid light, that soft effulgence
peculiar to Denmark, where the sunlight is so soft
and subdued and nothing stands out in harsh
contrast, the scenery lends itself to soothing
reverie. It has been given to few to commune
with Nature in her melting moods, "like Niobe
all tears." Corot stands for all time as having
pierced the veil, and Cazin has caught the quivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
play of ghostly light rarely made known to
mortals. The modern Copenhagen potters have,
"daring greatly," communed with Nature in like
manner. They have essayed to "snatch a grace
beyond the reach of art"&mdash;or of ceramic art.
But success is theirs. The transparent atmosphere
lending a pearly tone to the trembling
stretches of soft verdure and the cool limpid
shadows resting on the still meres are reflected
in the porcelain. The pictures are soothing and
restful; we can hear the flutter of the mallards
among the reeds.</p>

<p>Of the <i>paysage intime</i> there is profusion of wealth
in the long vista of the low-lying seashore of a
beautiful land, the wheeling gulls, the stretch of
dunes, and the circling procession of clouds over
a wind-swept sea. The poetry and dreamy
searchings of Copenhagen porcelain have held
the mirror to Nature. With outer eye illumined
with spiritual vision, the potters have translated
the soul of Nature's physical beauty into porcelain.
Here is the natural&mdash;but there is the vast, unfathomed
supernatural. Can it be possible that
there are yet other secrets of the magic of the
Northlands? Will the inner vision bring forth
into the furnace the dreams of the old world deep
in the Northern heart, buried these long centuries?
Can the potter poet call up the fleets of ghostly
ships that set forth from Trondhjem Fjord with
King Olaf and Olgafar the mystic boat with neither
sail nor helm nor galley oar? All the wealth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
dead ages lies as a hidden treasure-house for him
who can with wizardry open these portals and
bring back the Northern poesie. The Valrafy,
or Raven of Battle, loved the swell and the roar
of the fierce Northern Main. The ocean sprite
frequented the cold waters of the Baltic and
flashed, icy bearded, through the rack and cloud
of storm. Mermen and mermaidens still plash
in the sea-caves where mortals venture not, and
to this day in story and tradition they are
treasured in the hearts of fisher-folk and those who
go down to the sea in ships.</p>

<p>But these are vain imaginings, and to ask more
of an art already raised to a plane of evasive
and incommunicable inventiveness is to clamour
impertinently for the impossible.</p>

<p class="chap_overview">Form <i>versus</i> colour&mdash;The technique of modelling&mdash;The sound
principles of old Copenhagen porcelain&mdash;Underglaze succeeds overglaze
colouring&mdash;The love of animal life&mdash;Peasant types and children.</p>


<p>The highest test to apply to a figure subject in
porcelain is that it should be criticized in the
biscuit stage. The crudities, the disproportioned
ornament or the restless lack of cohesion become
at once evident, without the touches of colour
added to conceal the poverty of the art.</p>

<p>In our old factories at Plymouth and Bristol
in the hard paste and at Bow in the soft paste,
owing to an imperfect knowledge of the technique,
fire-cracks often appeared in the body of objects
intended for ornament. Collectors of experience
and mature judgment know exactly what the
potters did in these trying circumstances. The
scientific examination of the treasures of the
china cabinet has revealed many of the potter's
tricks. A fire-crack becomes the body of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
butterfly gaudily painted in rich colours. This
is one instance of the use of colour to conceal
the inexactitude of the craftsman. Similarly, in
figures it becomes a speculative question as to
what their character would turn out to be when
they were stripped of the gorgeous costumes with
which they are decked. Many a Chelsea figure
with rich brocaded surtout, yellow vest, and
breeches of amazing colour in scale pattern of
peacock hues, would turn out to be a veritable
scarecrow if stripped of the glories of pigment.
The colour has deceived the eye in regard to
form.</p>

<p>This love of colour and disregard of the niceties
of form has betrayed many enthusiasts into going
into raptures over monstrosities which would not
bear the light of day upon them if they were in
biscuit state. It is a matter for conjecture how
many Staffordshire figures or Toby Jugs, minus
pigment, would call for a word of praise judged
solely on their modelling and symmetrical beauty.</p>

<p>In Copenhagen, from the early overglaze painted
figures of the M√ºller period to the underglaze
decorated figures of the Renaissance style, there
is one quality that they have in common. This
is especially noticeable in comparing them with
work of other factories over an extended period
of time. They exhibit with unerring precision
the limitations of the potter in regard to the
medium in which he works. At no time has
the Copenhagen modeller attempted, save in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
decadent period when he copied Thorvaldsen's
sculpture, to encroach upon the work of the
silversmith or the glass-blower. He has been
true to the clay whose properties in the fire he
knows so well. The technique of modelling in
clay follows laws as definite as can well be laid
down. It is the same in all crafts where strict
observance is paid to the use for which objects
are created. The Japanese ivory-carver in his
<i>netsukes</i>, or ivory fastenings for garments, carves
them as nearly oval or round as is possible. It
may be a curled-up mouse, or an old man with
a barrel, or any other fanciful subject, but the
absence of spikes is the sign that the work is old
and not modern carving for the European markets,
when such objects bristle with points.</p>

<p>Similarly, in figures, for many reasons they should
have no jutting arms or over out-thrust ornaments.
First because in use they will be broken off. A
glance at the damaged specimens on the china
shelf will at once show the mistakes of the potter.
Rarely at the Copenhagen factory did the modeller
fancy for the moment he was a silver-worker and
leave a projecting arm. There is one instance
in an old figure most noticeable. A seller of
<i>kringler</i> has an outstretched hand offering his
ware for sale, but that is missing in the example
the writer examined.</p>

<p>Another reason for the avoidance of undue
extension is the technical difficulty of supporting
this in the oven during firing. Clay in the oven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
requires every assistance to keep it from warping
or bending over, and to introduce unnecessary
difficulties in modelling is to produce bad art.
This, coupled with the fact that porcelain shrinks
in firing to about six-sevenths of its original size,
is sufficient reason for the artistic potter to keep
strictly within the limitations of his technique.</p>

<p><b>The Sound Principles of Old Copenhagen Porcelain.</b>&mdash;Throughout
the M√ºller period it will be seen how carefully these axioms were
followed. In regard to the styles of decoration, the old school worked
in overglaze painting and the Renaissance school employs underglaze
painting. They are in complete contrast to one another in the treatment
of a subject. The narrow range of underglaze colours in a measure
limits the results of the decorator of figures. But it must not be
imagined that the overglaze school of painting, by reason of its freer
palette, allowed the modelling of the figures to be less than ideal.
A reference to the M√ºller chapter on <i>Figure Subjects</i> will show that
a great many examples were produced in white or in biscuit, and were
thus entirely independent of colour to help out any deficiencies in
modelling, if such existed.</p>

<p>An indication of the strong individuality of
the figure modelling of the Juliane Marie period,
is forthcoming in the fact that the factory
to-day is producing some of the coloured figures
of that period in white.</p>

<p><b>Underglaze succeeds Overglaze Colouring.</b>&mdash;Concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
the Renaissance figures as a whole,
there is a tendency to produce them in white;
this bespeaks great strength of modelling, and,
varied as they are in character, dealing with
different phases of life, they are never insipid.
But it may be advanced that the underglaze
colours are not extended enough in their range
to do justice to some of the costume subjects.
It seems to the present writer, and perhaps the
criticism is confirmed by a pronounced tendency
in that direction by the latest artistic movement
in the factory, that many of the modern figures,
such as peasant women in costume and the soldier
in Hans Andersen's story of the <i>Tinder Box</i>, would
give more complete results in overglaze painting.
This revival of overglaze painting in Copenhagen
in figures, and in combination with underglaze
work, is a new development which is being curiously
watched by connoisseurs and technical
experts.</p>

<p>The underglaze colours find complete harmony in the decoration of
figures of birds, and are delicate and true to nature in the modelled
fish, which have a graceful charm especially their own. They are a
perfect medium for placques and vases, depicting the long vaporous
clouds stretched across a leaden sky, the silvery blue transparent
billows tossing in from the Baltic, or in the foreground streaming
wearily over the level grey-yellow sand, flecked with the lilac
seashore flowers and tufts of grass on the sand-dunes. The pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span> sad
blues, the delicate greens, the amber, and pink, and dun-grey tones
verging into violet which are transmuted in the <i>grand feu</i> convey the
faint colours, the mist and the sadness, the storm and the rainy air,
the dim haze extending over meadow and lake, and the tremulously yellow
tones of sunset. The landscape is tinged with that soft melancholy
which tones down all harshness and softens all lines. Meditative,
somnolent, indecisive, liquid, limpid, and alluring in tender serenity,
these characteristics appeal to the soul of the artist as belonging
to the dream country of lakes and beech-woods and sand-hills and
kaleidoscopic waters. These intangible and wraith-like impressions have
been momentarily snatched by the potters and painters at the factory,
nor has anything been dropped in the fiery ordeal of the furnace,
and they stand in ceramic art as a permanent national record of the
homeland of the Dane.</p>

<p><b>The Love of Animal Life.</b>&mdash;There is one point
at which the modern figure subjects break new
ground. The Renaissance period is rich in its
love of the animal kingdom. The wheeling
gulls, the wild swans, and geese, and mallards,
wading and diving birds, and storks, and owls
have been modelled. The wild life of Denmark
has provided a new field. This is studied from
nature. There is a figure of a turkey, a denizen
of the factory grounds, modelled from life. What
other factory in the world is there where one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>
may meet, as did the writer, a turkey with her
brood being ushered from the garden up a staircase
into a pen in one of the studios? The
original with her brood may be seen illustrated,
p. <a href="#Illus_337">337</a>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FIGURE OF WOMAN AND COW.</p>
<p class="center">Painted in underglaze colours. Modelled by Chr. Thomsen.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Animals and fish have obtained full recognition
in the gallery of figure subjects. The Zoological
Gardens in close proximity to the factory has
provided the Polar bear and other studies. A
notable example of fine modelling is a <i>Sea Lion</i>,
which is life-like in its faithful representation.
The modelled fish, with the liquid glaze suggestive
that they have just been captured, are a remarkable
feature and are true in every detail&mdash;as true
as were the botanical specimens on the <i>Flora
Danica</i> service. They come as decorative objects
as surprisingly beautiful in form as are the birds,
and their variety captivates the lover of natural
form and subdued colour.</p>

<p><b>Peasant Types and Children.</b>&mdash;The peasant life of the country,
the costume, now fast disappearing, and the old-world character, still
happily preserved in many districts, were reproduced in the overglaze
figures of an earlier period. This love of veracity in costume and
environment is a feature which is traditional in the factory; it
therefore comes as no surprise to find that peasant types are produced
with underglaze treatment in colours. The only example of an animal in
the overglaze M√ºller period is the <i>Woman milking a Cow</i>, and a similar
subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span> a Milkmaid and Cow may be seen treated in modern manner in
underglaze style, with delicate suggestion of colour in the pale grey
dress, delicate blue shawl, and kerchief with infinitesimal spots. The
cow is white save for one or two splashes of light brown.</p>

<p>If Cupids be child-life, then the old style offers
scores of examples, but the modern child has
been denuded of his wings and is employed in
other occupations than twining wreaths of roses
around lovers. The usual children of the china
shelf are armed with baskets and posies, and are
Cupid-like in their character. But in the Renaissance
figures of Copenhagen children the spirit
of childhood is present. The simple peasant
<i>Child</i> (illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_279">279</a>), with burden of bottle
and basket, is as true to life as the faithful record
of an old Dutch master. It is, possibly without
meaning to be, symbolic of the life of toil of the
peasant. It is a tale the clay tells of the busy
life of the fields. Even a tiny child has to bear
her share of the long day's work. It is just
that sad touch of reflection which illuminates
great works of art, and it is here present. A
figure such as this is worth, as a work of art, fifty
meaningless Rockingham <i>Flower Boys</i> or Chelsea
manikins in grotesque costume.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Illus_275" name="Illus_275"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FIGURE OF BOY AND CALF.</p>
<p class="center">Painted in underglaze colours. Modelled by Chr. Thomsen.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Old Woman</i>, modelled by the same artist,
with bonnet and shawl with fringe, represents a
type now belonging to days rapidly passing. The
character of an obsolescent type has been caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
with exceptional cleverness. There is another
figure of an old woman less robust, and indicating
less lovable qualities, with Bible in hand, and, if
the truth be told, a somewhat crafty look. Such
types as these will be recognized by those who
know Denmark well; they are racy of the soil,
and represent the acute perception of the modern
potters in seizing disappearing types. Such
crystallized character forms a permanent and
very valuable record of the remoter side of country
life, and is instinct with a truer feeling of art
than whole galleries representing impossible porcelain
cavaliers and ladies in costume the like
of which no man has ever seen.</p>

<p>In dealing with the underglaze ware from its first application to
utilitarian services to its subtle use in placques and vases with
<i>grand-feu</i> colours, and finally in figure subjects and groups, it
will be seen, both in regard to mastery of technique and artistic
evolution, the natural order of development is that given in Chapter II
in examining the stages of overglaze painting and modelling. At that
period the order proceeds on lines of its own, and the usual stages of
progression were influenced by the fact that in the early days of the
factory Luplau, the first modelling-master, brought his experience to
bear on the work, and figure subjects of a high order were attempted
almost from the beginning. Here, in the Renaissance period, by
slower evolution and particularly sure processes, the modelling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>
figures has arrived at a state of undoubted excellence. Apart from
the first early inspiration when things Japanese broke upon Europe
with overwhelming force, the Copenhagen artists have obtained their
inspiration from within. They have followed the instincts of their own
race, and they have developed on lines essentially their own, both in
form, in colour, and in technique.</p>

<p>The Europe of sixty years ago was sated with
meaningless formalities. Tired with the repetition
of the scanty stock of Greek ornaments,
and in search of novelty, it is only natural that
men should turn their eyes to the only living
schools of decorative art then in existence. In
India, China, and Japan was found the freshness
that design needed. When M√ºller was producing
his masterpieces in clay, Wedgwood was transplanting
Greek gods and goddesses into Staffordshire,
and Chippendale was fashioning his fretwork
angles to tables and chairs, taken direct from
China. Between those days and the present is
the great wave of classicism which dug out Etruscan
vases and remodelled them, brought the Latin
chair into the early nineteenth-century drawing-room,
and with stilted affectation of simplicity
drove elegance and comfort far afield.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Illus_279" name="Illus_279"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PEASANT FIGURES.</p>
<p class="center">Painted in underglaze colours. Modelled by Chr. Thomsen.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of all Oriental schools it is thus natural that the
Japanese, with the unexpected and unsymmetrical
treatment of design, should appeal most at such
a time. The true and fine feeling of the Japanese
for birds and beasts, for the flower world and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
landscape in its larger features, is shown in all
their design, from the small ivory carvings to the
lacquer work or the colour prints of Katsuchika
Hokusai. The West has learned much from the
East in the nineteenth century. Whistler's
Nocturnes and Aubrey Beardsley's pen drawings
catch their germ of novelty from sources other
than European.</p>

<p>But "East is East and West is West," and
Copenhagen underglaze decoration has produced
the tones of the Northern world. Of all curious
happenings, it is singular to record that to-day
the Japanese ceramic artists are fashioning their
work in the same subdued tones, and producing
similar subjects in figures, to the little band of
ceramic workers in Denmark. In the history of the
manufacture of porcelain this is not exactly
a new thing. In England we have Worcester
copying Chinese examples and inventing a pseudo
mark, and the Bow and Lowestoft factories
copying Worcester's copy of Chinese originals.
Meissen and S√®vres have both suffered heavily
from votaries who have loved the originals so
well that they could not forbear from imitating
them. In England, at Worcester and at Coalport,
the copyists excelled in their love for the S√®vres
and Meissen originals by putting the marks of
those factories on their productions.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that Denmark, with no
coal and with no minerals, and with no quartz
and no china clay, should stand to-day as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
leading porcelain factory in Europe. In the
admirable article on <i>Ceramics</i> in the new edition
of the <i>Encyclop√¶dia Britannica</i> (1911) this verdict
stands: "The most admirable result of this
revived interest in Japanese art was, however,
developed at the Royal Copenhagen works, the
productions of which are not only famous all over
the world, but have set a new style in porcelain
decorations which is being followed at most of
the Continental factories." In connection with
figure subjects the same critic recognizes their
precious qualities. "The Royal Copenhagen
works have also produced a profusion of skilfully
modelled animals, birds, and fishes, either in pure
white or tinted after nature with the same
underglaze colours. Other European factories
have adopted the modern Copenhagen style of
decoration."</p>

<p>Something should be said in passing of the
domestic influence of the Royal Copenhagen
Factory upon the art of Denmark. Like a sturdy
oak-tree, the old factory has continued in its
steady growth from the days of Queen Juliane
Marie. It has weathered many storms, and now
proudly rears its head as a beloved landmark.
Its influence on generations of artists has been
deep and lasting. It has scattered its <i>largesse</i>,
and its sheltering branches have lent their protecting
shade to many grateful pilgrims. In
common with many another great factory, it has
added new impulses to the centre of its origin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
Like the acorn dropping from the parent tree,
productive of flourishing young oaks, so has it
been with the royal factory. It is pleasurable
to be able to record here the successes of a Copenhagen
porcelain factory conducted by Messrs.
Bing and Gr√∂ndahl. Their art is fresh and
winning, their painters have caught the touch of
the royal factory, and their modellers have found
inspiration in the work marked with the three
blue lines. The Bing and Gr√∂ndahl ware is
marked with the initials B &amp; G. It was originated
in the year 1853, and has been marked with a
successful career. Many of its productions are
to be found in museums side by side with work
of the royal factory. There is a spirit of
friendly rivalry between the ancestor and the
youthful scion. This is only natural. But the
old oak and the young tree will still continue to
flourish side by side, and the old oak will always
be the monarch of the forest, even a hundred
years hence, when painstaking collectors wrangle
as to dates and marks and weigh the B &amp; G with
the three blue lines, and find, as undoubtedly
they will, beauty and poetry reminiscent of the
Danish art.</p>

<p>Many of the early figure subjects of the Renaissance
period were of surprising originality, and
in some cases only one example was made. The
collectors who were fortunate enough to secure
these examples have since realized how happy was
their choice. There is one figure of a <i>Black Cat</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
exhibited at the Paris Exhibition, 1900, which
has never been repeated in black, owing to the
great difficulty experienced in manipulating the
glaze and the hazardous nature of the experiment.
White cats have been modelled in similar fashion,
but there is only one black Copenhagen cat, and
naturally such a rare piece is exceedingly valuable.</p>

<p>Among some of the later productions in figures
are some finely modelled subjects taken from
Hans Christian Andersen's <i>Stories</i>. Who does not
remember the <i>Tinder Box</i>, that tale of enchantment
where the soldier, coming home from the
wars, marching along the road with knapsack on
back, meets a witch who induces him to descend
into the great cavern and procure the magic tinder
box. A dainty little group in white represents
the <i>Soldier and the Witch</i>. We know of his sudden
rise to fortune, armed with a talisman as potent
as Aladdin's Lamp. The sleeping princess imprisoned
in a copper castle is brought to him by
the faithful canine genii of the tinder box. How
he narrowly escaped the gallows and finally took
the princess as his bride is one of our own nursery
stories, and there is a Copenhagen figure group
showing the soldier with his arm around the
princess in soldierly and lover-like fashion.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Princess and the Swineherd.</i><br />
(From Hans Christian Andersen's <i>Stories</i>.)<br />
Modelled by Chr. Thomsen.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The story of the <i>Swineherd</i> provides another
subject, and what grace and elegance and beauty
are in the lines, and delicacy in the sentiment.
It is an idyll in porcelain. Away with pierrots
and mimes, the fevered extravagances of imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
run riot in bizarre form and garish colour!
Such a group as this should have a niche to itself
in the china cabinet. It is superlatively chaste
and reticent, daintily conceived and faultless in
technique. The story is of the prince who became
swineherd to the father of the weary princess.
His taste for music took a mechanical turn in the
whimsical invention of a pot that played tunes
when it boiled, and, among other like toys, a
rattle that would play waltzes and polkas. His
hobby gained the fancy of the princess, who had
to buy them with kisses. The porcelain represents
the completion of the fairy-tale bargain.
Alas! there is no happy ending, for the kissing
became so fast and furious that the swineherd
threw off his disguise, became prince on a sudden,
and departed home to his kingdom, in disgust
with a princess who could look with disdain on
his presents of a rose and a nightingale because
they were only natural, and set her affections
on the trivialities of a swineherd.</p>

<p>Among the figures calling for regard in the
highest sense, that of the <i>Peacock</i> standing on an
urn, modelled by Arnold Krog, is of surprising
grace and symmetry. Its modelling is at once
true to nature and true to the requirements of
the potter's art. A model on a lower plane would
have placed the peacock on a base or tree-stump
and utilized this as a support, and no figure would
be complete without the gorgeous colouring of
the tail. This is exactly what happens in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[Pg 288]</span>
Derby figure of a Peacock (at the Victoria and
Albert Museum). On a rococo base covered with
a wealth of coloured flowers, a peacock stands in
brilliant natural colouring. But in the Copenhagen
figure the drooping tail is support enough
in the kiln, and the natural pose of the bird, proud
and erect, conveys dignity and beauty of form.
The treatment at Copenhagen is exactly the
opposite to the old school of ceramic artists.
Here it is beauty of form first and colour in
reticent subjection as an adjunct, and the results
are undeniably superlative.</p>

<p class="chap_overview"><i>Flamb√©</i> or transmutation glazes of the Chinese potters&mdash;The Royal
Copenhagen Factory produces the first specimen of crystallized glaze in
1886&mdash;Blue crackled glaze produced with design under control.</p>


<p>During the last decade of the nineteenth century
the Western potter came under the spell of the
modern chemist. Scientific study applied to
the body and glaze and vitrifaction of the materials
composing porcelain and faience, together
with a closer study of the exact conditions of
temperatures in the kilns, resulted in the discovery
of certain well-defined decorative qualities in
connection with glazes which, after considerable
experiment, offered practically a new field for
colour-work of a very beautiful nature.</p>

<p>In the <i>flamb√©</i> or transmutation glazes for which
the Chinese potters were renowned, the effects
of variegated or splashed colour are due to the
capricious action of the fire on the glazes during
the firing process. The single-coloured glazes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>
the Chinese applied to vases and other objects
have been much prized by Europeans. The
tints are very numerous, sea-green or celadon,
yellow, red, blue, purple, brown, black, and other
tones. These include the celebrated <i>sang-de-b≈ìuf</i>
colour of French collectors, so highly prized
in China. It is thought probable that many of
these single-colour glazes have been applied at a
somewhat lower temperature, termed by the
French <i>demi-grand feu</i>.</p>

<p>The mottled classes owe their appearance less
to the difference in the colouring matter than to
the manner in which it is applied. They are
termed in French <i>flamb√©</i>, and there is no doubt
that they were originally accidentally produced.
According to the letters of a Jesuit missionary,
P√®re d'Entrecolles, written in the early years of
the eighteenth century, such vases were called
<i>Yao pien</i> or <i>transmutation</i> vases. Such types,
with turquoise colour passing into green, green
melting into purple, and amber fading into grey,
are suggestive of the permutation of colour harmonies
which these transmutation glazes undergo
in the furnace.</p>

<p>Beside the <i>flamb√©</i> glazes there are crackled
glazes of turquoise-blue, apple-green, or of greyish
white. This crackle porcelain is now artificially
produced, but it doubtless owes its origin to
accident and caprice of firing.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In <i>flamb√©</i> glazes an English potter, Mr. Bernard
Moore, of Longton, has succeeded in producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span>
<i>sang-de-b≈ìuf</i> colour with delightful gradations
of tone; unhappily, some of these pieces were
destroyed by fire at the Brussels Exhibition
in 1910.</p>

<p><b>Copenhagen produces the First Crystalline Glaze.</b>&mdash;At
the Copenhagen factory <i>grand-feu</i> coloured
glazes have been developed in a remarkable
manner. The crystal glaze, the serpent-skin,
the tiger-eye, and crackled glaze, as well as many
other varieties, show effects which hitherto have
been unknown in porcelain, and have won the
admiration of all connoisseurs. The inception of
the crystalline glaze was due to Hr. Clement, the
chemist at the Royal Copenhagen Factory, and it
was owing to the indefatigable energy and experiments
of Hr. Clement that, in 1886, the first piece
of porcelain with crystalline glaze achieved a
record for the Copenhagen laboratory and studio.
Since that day other European potters have
succeeded in producing crystalline glazed ware
of exceptional beauty.</p>

<p>We illustrate a fine specimen of the early crystalline
glaze of Copenhagen now preserved at the
Museum of the National Porcelain Manufactory
at S√®vres. It represents a frog on a leaf. "We
should like specially to point out," says M. Edouard
Garnier, the Director of the Museum at S√®vres,
writing in 1894, "a large water-lily leaf on which
a frog is imbedded in a thin layer of ice, which
it has just succeeded in breaking. We have
never seen a more striking example of what may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[Pg 296]</span>
be attained by a purely scientific process applied
to art decoration, and we cannot repress the wish
that this example may be followed by our modern
ceramists." This is one of Arnold Krog's fine
conceptions.</p>

<p>This specimen of the work of the Copenhagen
chemist, Hr. V. Engelhardt, in crystallized glaze,
has been followed by many notable achievements
on his part. In 1902 there was a figure of a
<i>Polar Bear</i> lapping water, modelled by Arnold
Krog and produced in crystalline glaze by Hr.
Engelhardt. This, of which only thirty pieces
were made, was executed for an artistic club in
Paris. Another fine subject is that representing
two Polar Bears on the ice, one mounted on a
frozen pinnacle. The whole is a skilful piece of
modelling by C. E. Bonnesen, and crystalline
glazing by Hr. V. Engelhardt.</p>

<p>New shapes are continually being invented,
and a long chain of experiments in the laboratory
has resulted in the production of some very
remarkable examples of colouring which are
always welcome to collectors, who are quick to
realize that no two examples can ever be the
same. All colours can be handled in this manner.
The range is a wide one, and the surprising gradations
of tone have a charm undoubtedly their
own, and not unworthy to be regarded as representative
of some of the most wonderful creations
of the modern potter. The metallic oxides in
the hands of the twentieth-century chemist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span>
become possessed of magical properties and are
transformed into tender harmonies vibrating with
exquisite tones. Yellows, and blues, and browns
merge into mauve or grey, in delightful tenderness,
and black and white are included in the colour
schemes of which this style is now capable.</p>

<p><b>Blue Crackled Glaze.</b>&mdash;In regard to crackled
glazes there is evidence that they are coming
more under the governance of the chemist. There
is a beautiful deep blue variety produced at
Copenhagen, with a network of crackle graduated
to a nicety, now swelling, when on the belly of
the beaker or vase, and now contracting into
minute meshes when on the slender neck. This
is completely under mechanical control. As yet
blue is the only colour produced in this style.</p>

<p>At the Brussels Exhibition, 1910, the S√®vres
factory exhibited some large vases with crystalline
glaze evidently under the complete mastery of
the potter and chemist. These vases were of a
very fine character, and the suggestion arises
that at no far distant date the glazes now termed
"transmutation" or adventitious will be completely
mastered by the latest developments of
modern science as applied to pottery, and thus
"transmutation" will be a word of the past.</p>

<p>The technique of Copenhagen differs from that
of S√®vres or of Berlin. In these latter cases the
crystals appear like spots on the surface, whereas
in Copenhagen ware the crystals have a more
subtle and intimate incorporation with the glaze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>
They never stand on the surface, and often, as in
the mellow brown glaze, they lie beneath and
glow in reflected light.</p>

<p>A series of effects in broken colour, delicate in
marking and veined and mottled in most pleasing
character, is being attempted in vases. We
illustrate several types in whole and partial
crystallization, which lose considerably by appearing
as black-and-white illustrations. Such vases
are conspicuous for their revelry in colour, not
the hard, dense, opaque colours of the old Chinese
single glazes, but the limpid, vibrating, restless
subtleties of Nature's own play of pulsating colours
in changeful mood&mdash;the dazzling and fairy-like
opalescence of the frost and the deep blue of the
ice cave, or the pale amber sand-dunes imperceptibly
fading into a translucent green stretch
of waters, with the vaporous haze of a violet sky.
In the white heat of the modern furnace the
flowers of a prehistoric day, which have lain
buried in the coal seams of an alien land, transmute
the dull clay and the mineral glaze under
the hand of the modern magician into colour
nocturnes.</p>

promise of a new school&mdash;The rich output of colour
and inventive form.</p>


<p>The student of ceramic art well knows that
porcelain and earthenware, although as poles
asunder in their technique, do oftentimes touch
one another in apparent affinity. For instance,
what is more earthen than the brown crumbling
body of the Dutch delft ware? It is a poor relation
of porcelain. But the Dutch potter had in
mind the great prototypes of the East. His dishes
and his jars were an attempt to copy blue-and-white
Kang-He porcelain. He covered his brown
body with a white enamel and painted his tulips
and his Batavian-Chinese designs to imitate the
Dutch East India Company's examples he had
before him. He created a new art, but he started
as a copyist. Beautiful as is Delft, it is really
only a simulation in earthenware of blue-and-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
porcelain. Similarly in regard to English
earthenware, with the noteworthy exceptions of
a few types essentially true to the technique of
earthenware, it is singular how peculiarly obtuse
the Staffordshire potters have been to the limitations
of earthenware. They have assiduously
attempted to bring it into line with porcelain in
its decoration and its appearance. The line of
demarcation between earthenware and porcelain
has become in England very indefinite, owing to
the fact that true porcelain is not manufactured
in this country. In consequence, the artificial
composition of the body of English porcelain,
where calcined bones form an addition to the
Chinese formula of true porcelain, has brought it
into closer relationship with earthenware than
is the case in any other European porcelain.
"Semi-porcelain," a term in English ceramics,
is not to be found elsewhere. It is still a moot-point
whether to classify Wedgwood's jasper
ware as earthenware or porcelain. "Ironstone
china," a hardware introduced by Mason in 1830
and copied by other potters, is earthenware, and
the instances could be multiplied of confusion in
nomenclature. But where, as on the Continent,
only hard paste that is true porcelain in the
Chinese manner is produced, save at S√®vres, the
distinction between this and earthenware is most
clearly defined.</p>

<p>At Copenhagen, therefore, the manufacture of
faience at a porcelain factory was a leap into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
unknown. Not only were different kilns to be
employed, but a different technique and especial
conditions governed the manufacture. The
theories which had been skilfully put into practice
and the ideals which had been reached in the art
of porcelain were alien to the new departure in
the field of faience. To have welded together
the two arts and the two techniques would have
ruined the enterprise at its commencement. The
two streams were allowed to run apart, and the
result is an artistic achievement no less noteworthy
than the Renaissance of the Royal Copenhagen
porcelain. The mantle of Philip Schou has
descended on his son-in-law, Frederik Dalgas,
who has ably continued the traditions of his
predecessor in the management of this national
enterprise. The inception and development of this
art faience of Copenhagen is due to Mr. Frederik
Dalgas, who brought a keen and virile intuition
into this new field of ceramic adventure.
Whereas in the porcelain there is delicate artistry
and finesse, in the faience there is breadth and
vivacity of colour schemes. Never do the twain
touch each other in kinship. The faience is not
a poor kinsman of the porcelain. It is a new
creation, a fresh and forceful note in ceramic art.
It has a relationship with bygone majolica of
another land. It is a transplantation of a southern
stock into a northern clime. One is reminded of
those labels at Kew Gardens indicating that certain
rare trees from sunnier lands have been acclimatized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span>
and have become beauty spots in a far
country.</p>

<p><b>The Slow Growth of a New Art.</b>&mdash;It is always
interesting to the student to examine specimens
belonging to the experimental stage of an art.
It is here that the potter struggling with his new
technique betrays in his <i>motifs</i> suggestions as to
its origin. There are very few wares in ceramic
art that stand out as supremely original. In
some way or another they bear relationship to
earlier potters' work, as a rule. Whole schools
of artistic potters have been avowedly copyist.
This is a truism in regard to European ceramic
art as a whole: it is admittedly derivative from
Oriental prototypes. But in regard to various
branches of pottery apart from porcelain, there
is little doubt that it has a long lineage. It is
therefore possible to compare the stages of evolution
of faience in the Western countries and to
realize that since Greek and Roman and Etruscan
days man was a progressive potter, though even
in this field derivative technique came from east
of Suez. The earliest examples of the Copenhagen
faience suggest that the old Italian majolica
models had lingered in the memory of the potters
making their essay into a new domain. Those
who have carefully watched the slow but sure
growth of this art faience of Copenhagen will
have come to realize how surely the potter has
put his foot on a new plane and established something
that is characteristic and original. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span>
by a gradual process year by year added new forms,
created dishes and beakers of sound design, and
perfected the decorations in colour till they have
reached something which is gay without being
garish and exuberant in rich colouring without
being other than surprisingly harmonious. One
wonders how the Oriental rug-weaver can place
his blues and his reds seemingly so disastrous to
tone effect. But there they are, and, either by
strong contrast or perfect harmony, the results
are artistically true. It is the same question one
asks of the colour effects in the Copenhagen art
faience. They are perfectly luscious and strikingly
original. No one else has employed these
combinations of pigments, nor their wide range
of colours. They appear to have been produced
by magic. But to any one with a
working knowledge of a great factory will come
the reflection that the apparent magic is the
wizardry of genius, and genius has been defined
as the infinite capacity for taking pains. The
strenuous work, the long vigils, the indefatigable
and indomitable determination to accomplish the
mastery of the technique is here evident. It is
the strong and fruitful harvest of a slow growth
carefully tended in an especially artistic environment
by trained minds.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Old Masters of Majolica.</b>&mdash;The Italian school
with its glazed ware of polychrome decorative
effects, Faenza, Caffaggiolo, Urbino, Pesarro,
and later its lustre (notably the ruby ware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
Gubbio), was partially derivative from Persian
and from Hispano-Moresque prototypes. Figure
subjects form an important feature. Groups in
contemporary costume, portraits, and religious
or allegorical subjects, as well as heraldic devices,
occupy the centre of the dish. But the border
is a framework which is richly decorated with
brilliant and varied colours. The designs are
conceived in the best vein of sixteenth-century
fecundity of invention. Elaborate floriate ornament
is in combination with satyrs and grotesque
masks, or cupids, or birds, or sea monsters. It
suggests the sprightly grace which enlivens the
tail-pieces engraved in contemporary Italian books.
Design, till it ran riot later, was exuberant, and
there seemed no end to the outburst of originality
and imagination.</p>

<p>It is to these old masters, particularly of the
Italian period from about 1480 to about 1580,
that one turns for great ideas and perfect execution.
Before the latter date signs were evident
that the art was declining: already the secret of
the Gubbio ruby lustre had been lost.</p>

<p>The earlier Persian pottery and the Rhodian
ware, produced as far afield as Damascus and
Ispahan, had disseminated the wondrous technique
of the East. The Hispano-Moresque ware of
Malaga and Valencia, a century earlier than the
greatest period of the Italian school, gradually
lost its Moorish character with arabesque design
and pseudo-Arabic characters, till, in the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[Pg 321]</span>
sixteenth century, designs in contemporary
Spanish costume and broad floriate borders found
favour. The copper lustre was, however, still
a feature.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">COPENHAGEN ART FAIENCE.</p>
<p class="center">Vase with hexagonal top and base, richly decorated with flowers and
arabesque ornament, by Christian Joachim.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that the old masters
are the fount from which so much has been derived.
Nevers, Rouen, and Moustiers caught the colour-schemes
of Persia and Italy, and each in turn
made them her own. In studying the finest
work of the old masters of faience we see that the
technique is something very different from what
Staffordshire has made it. John Dwight in the
seventeenth, and Thomas Whieldon in the eighteenth
century both worked on sound lines. It
is not high art to attempt to make faience simulate
porcelain, any more than it is when wall paper
pretends to be marble, or leather, or tapestry.
Porcelain shows as much of its white body and
sparkling glaze as is possible. It depends, as
does an etching, on its uncovered background for
its luminous effects and its atmosphere. Faience
is like an oil painting: it demands that the whole
surface be covered. It has a yellow, or brown,
or green, or lilac ground. The decoration, in
contradistinction to porcelain, is broad and strong.
There are no finicking "Chantilly sprigs" in
faience. Bold, virile, and striking must be the
notes that dominate faience, but withal&mdash;and
herein lies the supremest difficulty&mdash;it must be
na√Øve and simple. It must not suggest the
palace, and certainly not the boudoir. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[Pg 322]</span>
bespeak the open air. It is the perennial herbaceous
border in ceramic art, and not the hot-house
or the conservatory.</p>

<p><b>The Great Promise of a New School.</b>&mdash;Lovers of Copenhagen ware
and connoisseurs who were aware of the possibilities of faience
produced under rightly understood principles have not been disappointed
in the art faience which Mr. Christian Joachim has made his own under
a group of trained artist potters. His is the guerdon of praise, and
the laurel wreath should be placed on his head for his services to the
art of his native country. He has happily received the support of a
farseeing directorate. His life record will stand as a great triumph
for the Copenhagen art faience. What Arnold Krog has done in porcelain,
Christian Joachim has done in faience. With a fine appreciation of
the limitations of his technique, and with a bold imagination as to
further possibilities in modern conditions, he has sent forth his
pottery with a message of gaiety and youth. No man is a prophet in his
own country. But in Europe and in America Christian Joachim's work has
become noteworthy. Danes the world over buy it because it is Danish. We
English and other strangers buy it because it is beautiful art.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In an examination of the art tendencies of the new school, it would
appear that in the attempt to be surprisingly original there is the
wilful abandonment of anything suggestive of Persian, or Rhodian, or
Moorish, or Italian ideals. The <i>motifs</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[Pg 325]</span> are especially modern,
and the schemes of colour are skilfully handled in a novel manner,
and owing to scientific development the potter's palette is more
extensive than heretofore. The promise has already been fulfilled, and
connoisseurs await later developments with no little curiosity.</p>

<p><b>The Rich Output of Colour and Inventive Form.</b>&mdash;The
illustrations to this chapter lack colour,
and therefore they cannot do justice to what is
one of the most important features in the new art
faience. Among the pigments that are used are
the following, no incomplete range in comparison
with what has gone before in this ceramic field.
The Dutch found blue the least refractory of
colours, and adhered largely to its use till later
they employed yellow. Rouen employed yellow
and red and green. But Copenhagen has a
palette consisting of cream, yellow, green, blue,
red, lilac, and a warm plum colour or purple.
This latter colour, the product of scientific
modernity, is wielded with a sure hand by Christian
Joachim and his school of artists. It is
in such examples as the dish and the placque
with tropical birds (illustrated, pp. <a href="#Illus_307">307</a>, <a href="#Illus_311">311</a>) that
the rich colour effects procurable are seen at
their best. In the placque extreme simplicity
and artlessness of design is exhibited in the floral
border. In the dish the border is luxuriant with
colour, although broad in treatment. Such examples
are extremely decorative, and exhibit this
branch of ceramic art on a high level. They attain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span>
their excellence by methods of their own. They
cannot be confounded with the productions of
any other factory, either older or contemporary.
Their originality is a factor not to be eliminated
in adjudging them.</p>

<p>In vases and other vessels demanding attention
to form there is apparent the striving, natural
in all potters, for unique forms. A fine vase
with rich floral decoration (illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_315">315</a>)
follows the early Italian drug pot. Another
breaks new ground, and its square hexagonal
surfaces require a touch of geometric ornament,
rarely found in Copenhagen faience (illustrated,
p. <a href="#Illus_319">319</a>). Punch-bowls with covers, having as a
knob a full-sized lemon in natural colours, are
novel and utilitarian. The modelling of Mr.
Harboe and of Mr. Slott-M√∂ller is deserving of
recognition. <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> was
performed some years ago in the open air in a
glade in the Deerhavn, near Copenhagen, before
some thousands of people. It is natural, therefore,
to find little faience figures of Bottom the
Weaver, of Flute the Bellows-mender, and of
Philostrate the Master of the Revels, of Puck, of
Oberon and of Titania, and of delightful fairies.
These are not conjured up from the German translation
by Schlegel of Shakespeare's plays, but
from Shakespeare's own imaginings, minus the
addition of the heavy hand of German <i>Kultur</i>.
We do not remember that Staffordshire has
attempted to reproduce Shakespearean characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span>
in clay, though at one time, after Wedgwood,
Jupiter and Venus and other alien gods and goddesses
were found on every cottager's mantelshelf.
The Copenhagen figures of <i>Clown</i>, <i>Columbine</i>, and
<i>Harlequin</i> are pleasing in their graceful simplicity
(illustrated, p. <a href="#Illus_327">327</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Illus_327" name="Illus_327"></a>
<img src="images/page327.jpg" width="600" height="365" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">COPENHAGEN ART FAIENCE.</p>
<p class="center">Figures&mdash;Clown, Columbine, and Harlequin&mdash;by Christian Joachim.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Boxes&mdash;<i>bonbonni√®res</i> as the French term them&mdash;are
produced in great variety. We reproduce
two, broadly decorated and having covers with
original design of bird and wood sprite. This
latter follows the true canons of plastic art. He
is as rotund, with no breakable projections, as a
Japanese ivory button <i>netsuke</i>. With them is
illustrated a vase Persian in character, but with
modern colour effects. All this is excellent, but
one asks for more. In wishing the new school
of the North <i>bon voyage</i>, we may be allowed to
express a hope that it will continue its outburst
of resplendent colour and perpetuate its virile
design, that it may worthily vie with the great
masters of faience in the South and in the East.
In regard to personal inclinations, the writer would
like to see sometimes embodied in the decorative
borders of placques and vases the interlaced work
of Runic design, symbolic of the Norse mystery
and magic. If the Italian saints find place on
the <i>tazzas</i> of Faenza, surely Thor and Wodin,
who gave their names to two days of the week,
and other heroes of Northern mythology, should
be embodied in this Copenhagen gallery. The
triumphs of the Vikings and their sagas quicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span>
the imagination. Of heroes of later date, one
could wish to see Cnut at the English seashore,
or the rugged portrait of old Christian IV.</p>

<p>It may be that these vain cravings for pages
from the past run not attune to the dreams of
the master potter with an eye to the future;
possibly decorative technique forbids&mdash;but here
are the stray lines of a foreign spectator in kindly
spirit.</p>

<p>In the word <i>factory</i> there is nothing suggestive
of poetry. In England it represents the Frankenstein
who has slain many cottage industries. In
connection with our own potteries there are the
Five Towns, merged into one, with a quarter of
a million of inhabitants. They stand for organized
science and applied manufacture. Their architecture
is an architecture of chimney-shafts and
kilns, black with smoke. It is a prosperous
district, crammed with the workers in a gigantic
industry. There are visions of murky canals
and great hills of accumulated rubble of the mines,
coal and copper and iron, dug from the bowels
of the earth and blotting out the skyline.</p>

<p>There are crowded byways filled with hurrying
operatives, men and women and girls. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>
beauty of the rich, green, undulating lands of
Staffordshire has been effaced by this delving of
human moles. It is as though some ruthless giant
had made sport of the hills and worked havoc
on a smiling plain. But modern life demands
sacrifices, and chinaware must be made to send
to the four corners of the earth&mdash;this is the great
White Country.</p>

<p>In Denmark things are managed differently.
It comes as a welcome surprise to the English
visitor, educated to other scenes, to find the
Royal Porcelain Factory set in a pleasant suburb
of the city near the old gardens of the Palace of
Frederiksberg. One cannot have an omelette
without breaking eggs: the factory chimneys are
there, the green-hedged paths are surely a snare
leading up to another such prison-house as are
all factories the world over. Here are the heaps
of quartz, and we catch the hum of the machinery.
The workers are in the hive; some unkind sprite
has snatched them from the pleasant ways of a
delightful city set by the sea and immured them
for their sins in this fortress of stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Illus_337" name="Illus_337"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">COURTYARD OF ROYAL COPENHAGEN FACTORY.</p>
<p class="center">Showing turkey and brood.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It suggests the story of B√∂ttger and his workmen
imprisoned by reason of the secrets they held.
Surely these workmen and artists who know the
secret of the Copenhagen ware will not be allowed
to escape. It is too precious a thing to Denmark
that its secrets be divulged. But the reply comes
suddenly when the doors are opened and the
secret, that is no secret, is disclosed. These men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span>
and women are Danes, and proud of their art
and filled with the love of their Copenhagen
porcelain. They come and go as they will. Like
bees they roam over the flowers and the gems of
nature, and they return home to the hive because
they love their art. That which their hand findeth
to do, they do with all their might.</p>

<p><b>Facility for Study of Animal and Plant Life.</b>&mdash;There
is sunshine here in this Northern pottery.
The courtyard shows a scene no other factory in
the world can offer; it is bewildering to a student
of potteries: a turkey with her brood proudly
dominates the scene. We have with the camera
caught this as a record. It is as suggestive as
it is remarkable that the artists have carried their
love for fidelity so far that flowers and animals
and birds find themselves in suitable environment
at this strange enchanted factory.</p>

<p>Animal life is dear to the potters here. There are over three hundred
moulds of different types&mdash;wading and diving wild fowl from the remoter
"haunts of coot and hern"; sea-gulls, never absent from the harbour
and canals spanned by bridges over which trams pass; bears and seals,
the originals of which are to be found at the Zoological Gardens
close by; and if the Ph≈ìnix&mdash;that fabulous bird which lives for five
hundred years, making its nest of spices and burning itself to ashes,
coming forth with renewed life for another five hundred years&mdash;could be
captured, it would find a place in the aviary of the factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span> which,
Ph≈ìnix-like, has arisen with youth and vigour.</p>

<p><b>The Absence of Lead Poisoning.</b>&mdash;In place of
the white-faced factory workers, we find at the
Copenhagen factory a healthy band of workmen,
artisans, and artists, employed in conditions that
are a credit to all concerned. The usual drudgery
of a pottery is eliminated as much as possible in
this factory. The latest modern appliances to
ventilate the dust-laden air are in use. <i>There are
no cases of lead-poisoning, because lead is not used
in the factory either in pigments or in glazes.</i> A
dining-hall and dressing-rooms have been erected
for the workmen. The factory provides its own
electricity and mechanical power; it is heated
throughout by hot water, and has a complete

<p>The lady artists work in almost ideal conditions.
They are installed in studios filled with flowers
and plants, and in no other factory are the artistic
conditions so favourable to the study of plant
and animal life. The photographs we reproduce
are taken of the normal surroundings of everyday
work.</p>

<p>The writer has indelible memory pictures of
the workmen at the machinery, or in the open
air turning over the quartz where it lies in heaps
"weathering," exposed to the sun and the frost,
of slowly grinding stones revolving in a vat mixing
and amalgamating the raw materials, in preparing
them for the next stage of handling, revealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[Pg 343]</span>
the slow and patient processes of the potter's art.
There is something hazardous in manipulating
the raw materials, crushing them into powder,
and bringing them together in the correct proportions
for the body. It is here that the long
traditions of the factory, the well-guarded secrets
in the mixing, and the skilful instinct in conjunction
with scientific exactitude, come into full
operation. The result is evident in the smooth,
white, pearly body and the transparent liquid
glaze, so technically perfect and so much admired
by other potters.</p>

<p>One recalls an anxious and expectant group at
the ovens when a firing is being removed after
the ovens have cooled down from the intense heat
of the <i>grand feu</i>, a temperature never attempted
by the manufacturers of soft-paste porcelain in
this country.</p>

<p>The laboratory holds mysteries of its own. It
is an inner sanctum to which few penetrate.
These little human touches indicate that there
is a romance in manufacture as well as in more
stirring scenes to the accompaniment of the roll
of the drum or the rousing bugle-call. The
potter's art is rich in associations which render
the arts of peace as alluring in story as the arts
of war. Many victories have been won in silence,
but no less triumphant for that, and these represent
man's conquest of earth and the white-hot
flame of the furnace, whereby he transmutes the
rocks from the quarry and the mountain-side into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[Pg 344]</span>
crystal vases reflecting those same mountains,
and streams, and placid lakes, and clouds in
stately procession. This is the art of the magician,
and modern science has added one more laurel
wreath to her victories over the elements.</p>

<p>The interior of a great factory where art is in
the making has many exciting moments. The
cruel fire is no respecter of persons. After the
various steps have been taken, the grinding,
the mixing, the moulding into form, the firing in
biscuit, the painting, and the subsequent glazing,
the creation comes out of the oven as a finished
work of art. At any one of these stages a slip
may mean disaster. Each successive process
gains in difficulty. It is a tragic instant when
the last hour is reached. After the oven has
cooled the news goes round that a firing is being
taken from the kiln. A knot of artists gathers
round as each piece comes out. Some call for
admiration; there is a hush of joyful surprise
when a completed masterpiece comes forth perfect.
Alas! too often some delightful dream with its
tender colours has twisted out of shape in the
intense heat. A graceful form has coalesced with
a neighbouring vase. They stand as failures,
and the workman with swift, relentless hand gives
them a tap with a hammer, and they become
shards. The poet-painter's dream has ended in
nothingness.</p>

<p><b>New Impulses.</b>&mdash;In regard to the future there
are golden hopes and happy anticipations. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>
past has been glorious, the present is triumphant.
A true and living school of design amid sound
artistic environment has its band of artist-potters,
trained under happy auspices, whose aims are
set steadfastly on art that is nothing unless it be
national&mdash;these are the children of to-morrow.
New generations will come and go, and new art
impulses will beat, as the waves breaking from
the Baltic, on the little pottery set on a rock and
proud in its great achievements. The future,
like the vessel in the furnace, is in the hands of
Fate. Taking courage in both hands, the potter-sons
of Denmark will in those yet unborn days
carry on the great traditions. There is a great
heritage for the sons of the days to come, and
looking backward, they will place the laurel wreath
on the brow of the masters who, in the old days
and at the present era, have fought the good fight
and won the guerdon of praise from potters in
far-off lands who have paid homage to the art of
the Three Blue Lines.</p>

<h2 class="center">Transcriber's Note</h2>
<p>The background has been dropped out of some of the illustrations where it was easy. However many illustrations have the portions
of the edge of the pottery in shadow and it is impossible to tell where boundary is, between the pottery and the background.
In others, the background was left in the illustration for consistency.</p>
<p>Illustrations have been moved from their location in the original book so they do not break paragraphs. The links in the
List of Illustrations point to the illustrations, not the cited page numbers.</p>
<p>Archaic and unusual spellings have been maintained as in the original book. Some spellings have been changed to bring
conformance between the List of Illustrations, the body of the book and the Index. These are detailed in the table below and
in the <span class="correction" title="Original text shown here">text</span>.</p>
<p>In researching the correct spelling of Francesco Antonibon's name regarding his letter to Lady Charlotte Schreiber, it came
to light that the cited work, "Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain" by William Chaffers does exist, but does not contain
the cited information. A related work by the same author, "Marks and Monograms on European and Oriental Pottery and Porcelain with
Historical Notices of Each Manufactory" contains the cited information. The citation has not been changed in the footnote in
this book.</p>
